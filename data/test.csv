"I am a tutor working with special children, I find it easy when i adapt with the child in his way always reminding him that he is capable of doing things, not fast and rashly, but slow and smartly. i keep boosting them to read aloud sound the words and put them down I have found it easier to cope with their studies by translating in the medium they know best , repetitive reading,, selecting key words and putting them down in writing.

"All in all, this was a tough course, and the programming increased progressively as one moved on. Week 1 was OK, but I experienced a temporary hiccup in week 2 in the reading of the codon files; until I converted them to Strings. Even then the first file which contained only one DNA string gave its fair share of problems. In general, the section on Strings was pretty comprehensive. The programming was also pretty challenging. The section on debugging was OK, but I am at this stage still a little confused as to the amount and detail of information one is supposed to supply to someone else when you are experiencing a problem with your code. With the week 2 quiz I made a mistake than came back to haunt me in week 4; I did not read the question properly and from the outset my cgRatio method was not producing the correct answer. Eventually, after reading the specs for cgRatio again, I realised my mistake, could correct my code and get through the week 2 quiz! Week 3 on parsing, reading CSV files etc, the going was pretty good and I managed to complete the work covered in this section without too many problems. Week 4 on baby names; well, yes the mini Project was pretty extensive, with a lot of Methods being asked for and written. I found the small test files to be invaluable during testing. But the quiz contained a few curved balls. Method totalBirths does just that, and although in the specification it does say that it should also print the number of girls and boys names, and the total names in the file. Q1 and 2 tripped me up, I did not read them properly, and entered the total number of births for the girls and boys respectively. Questions 9 to 12 also resulted me in having to call a temporary halt, and write an additional method that looped over all the files from 1880 to 2014 in order to get the answers to those questions. Fortunately, method getRank came to the rescue here, doing all of the hard work!This was a lot of work! I did week 4 in one week, but only because I was already on leave and could focus on the mini project for the entire week. The entire course took me 6-7 weeks to complete.I learned a lot. It was a good course, and very challenging. My greatest concern with the format you are using (80% or you dont move on - or you dont qualify), is that one can become unstuck as I did in week 2, but managed to get past that one.",0.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

"[Slightly updated according to Michaels questions]The course is fine, but comparing to the previous one - Algorithmic Toolbox - this one is weaker and with lesser quality.Pros: the course contains some interesting data structures and valuable observations. The starter files for assignments are in place. Related books are given after each video session. All the tasks have automatic grader. There is a couple of interesting tasks to do.Cons: the material is mostly lectures, and there is even a video where lecturer just reads the article from Wiki (Splay tree - has the same information with same lack of some proofs). Expected: add quizzes as it was in the first course. The course has less weeks - only 4 as comparing to 5 in AT. So various important data structures are not discussed. The course has less homework - 3 tasks each week as comparing to 5 in AT. And all 3 are usually just implementations of some basic algos seen in lectures.I consider the course valuable due to a number of good videos and a couple of good tasks to do.

"I get lost a bit too often.The teacher sometimes explains easy concepts and omits the difficult ones (e.g. exponential distribution is explained as for example if you are waiting for a bus that comes every ten minutes and then he tells you how to compute expected value and moves on, but he does not say WHAT IT MEANS - is it the probability that I will meet an oncoming bus? is it probability of waiting ten minutes for the bus? is it the average waiting time? is it average number of buses that come every hour? - but there is detailed explanation of what A squared means in lesson two (!))The teacher often makes me confused as to where he got the numbers he is plugging in the formula or what answer the formula gives.But I take it as a challenge and I intend to finish the course despite all of that. Sometimes it is fun to decipher the mystic equations. And maybe it is me, maybe I was not born to be a statistician.

"This was by far the worst course in the series.There is a lot of good content in this course that needs to be shared, but I just felt the delivery failed in a lot of ways.Here are some issues1) Often, concepts are thrown out but arent explained clearly. Speaker glosses over them without giving concrete examples2) The structure of the course is poorly configured. On several occasions, inline quizzes test you on concepts that havent been introduced until later in the video, forcing you to guess at answers. Also, the assignment portion of the course asks you to submit a word or pdf with images, but it wasnt configured to allow uploads. You could only submit text in a text box. I realized I wasnt the only person with the issue when I graded assignments from others who had trouble submitting their assignment. In some cases, I believe students failed that portion of the course because they could not figure out how to submit. I have some IT background and was able to share my homework through my shared drive fortunately.3) The speaker should re-record his lecture. It was obvious (or at least seemed as if) he was reading a teleprompter. There were many awkward pauses between sentences that made it hard to listen to.

"Really interesting course but I have some recomendations:1)Ive missed that the professors would have done more example exercises on every lesson2)The value of the certificate to others (ie to find a job) is how hard is to pass the course or the minimum knowledge that the student adquires. The evaluation system makes it very easy to cheat (with 3 attemps every 8 hours for the practice sets or the exam). With test-type answers it is very easy to pass the course even if you havent watched any lesson video or learnt anything.3) For point 2 I recommend that the check system on practice sets and the exam could be able to accept numeric or simbolic answers (not test-type) so that it will have infinite answers and nobody could cheat the system (in Edx Ive done some courses that have this system). Another option could be that every attempt that you make substracted 10% on the calification of that practice set, so if youve already done the practice set twice you could only get 70% tops on the third attempt.Thanks to the staff!",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"The content of the course is excellent. Descriptions are also excellent and very complete. The course has been created so that most people can understand whats happening here (even if youre new to programming).Im only giving this 4 stars because there are some things that make this course too slow, in my opinion. I dont think you need to mention which file we are working on [after the first couple of times] because we can easily see that by the name of the file and the browser of Sublime. Those are a few seconds that are a waste of time.Secondly, I think that the questions in the practice questionnaires are a bit too easy. I didnt feel like they prepared me enough for the project at the end of week 2. You mostly ask if something is true/not which is too easy to guess. I think you would greatly improve the quality of the course if you designed some mini-situations. For instance (not sure if Coursera allows it), show a mini mockup and give 10 lines of code. Then ask how you will add another div to the top right of the mockup so that it aligns with the current code without breaking. Making those exercises not the same as your lecture code is going to help improve self-awareness. Currently, I think that people find it way too easy to select the right answer, since its easy to remember what you said and what not.I also understand that you wanted us to like the page for good reasons (because you look an extremely radiant and happy person) but I think you oversold it a bit. You should have mentioned that once or twice, but no more. Seeing it in a few of the examples wasnt quite my cup of tea.On a good note, I was extremely [pleasantly] surprised when you did that real world project thing. That was an amazing idea and youre executing the details quite well (not writing 100% code on-screen, etc.). I really like how you sometimes say that we should look up the reference by ourselves, since thats what most programmers do (I study CS and after 3 years, plus a 6 month internship at a big company, this cant be more true).Im definitely giving this a 5* if you fix the questions to be harder and a bit more different to what you said in the respective video. They should make you think. Also, some of them could be open answers, requiring you to recall classes/code by memory (or cheat by watching the video).

"When I started this course, my only experience with HTML was <b> bold</b>, <i> italic</i>, and <u>underline</u>. After this course I have a much clearer understanding of what HTML is, and how it works, and I am able to now use it to a much greater extent than I was before.The professor did an excellent job of explaining most things, but I did find that on occasion I had to stop the video and go back several times to understand what shed said or to take notes, despite having slowed the video down as much as possible. (In my opinion, one should be able to slow the video down more than is currently possible, especially for those for whom English is not their native tongue.) With me, it wasnt that I didnt understand what she said so much as I didnt have time to take in what she meant before shed gone on to something else.I understand that Coursera is able to do what it does because of its method, which is basically independent study; one watches the videos, and reads whatever resources are listed, and goes on from there. If there is a question, it is not the professor in the videos that the question is asked of, but people hired as teaching aides. These are the people (other than fellow students) who answer your questions, and they do not always answer in a timely fashion. While this method works well for some people, I am quite sure there are others unable to learn with this method, especially if the subject turns out to be a more complicated, intensive one. Some people need to have a little more than just videos which they can only repeat over and over with the same information, hoping to learn something new from it.The only other thing I have a problem with is the lack of oversight/security. Theres no way of knowing if the person who earns a certificate is the person they claim to be, or if they earned the scores given.All in all, I think Coursera is a great tool, and well worth the low prices charged; I am sure there are plenty of courses still remaining (after the purge) that I would love to take.",1.0,1,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

"You will have to make a Scratch account (free) for this course.Areti is a very clear instructor that explained concepts very well for complete beginners into programming, like myself and I found the course insightful.1) Presentation - I couldnt help but wonder whether they had a lower target age (teenagers or younger) in mind, which was entertaining at some points but also distracting at other times. // Also, I only realized halfway through the course that it is in fact possible to see what Areti is doing on the Scratch program once the quality of the video is adjusted.2) Projects/Time Commitment - Going through the lectures and quizzes are not time consuming at all, but the projects (especially the final project) takes a lot of time. It took longer than expected because I felt like much of the practical instructions on how to use Scratch for specific purposes were not provided during the course, leaving me to work by myself.3) Discussion Forum - When I took the course, the discussion forum was close to being dead (especially compared to some of the other courses that I was taking simultaneously on Coursera). Gerry (mentor) did an amazing job responding to my inquiry, but I noticed that although there were a lot of students talking at the beginning, introducing themselves, there werent that many discussions concerning the final assignment, making me feel like I was working alone. It would be great if there was more time to work on the final project, and perhaps a way in which students can collaborate and help out others when faced with a bug (ie preliminary project submission and feedback session).I recommend taking this course, but realistically, you wont be program proficient after 5 weeks.

There is only one diff I have found in one specific question, that is, I didnt use the same format to define one constraint.

"Algorithmic Toolbox consists of a series of slides containing slimmed down explanations on introductory algorithmic concepts, followed up with programming assignments. The slides are the centrepiece of the course, as the presenters rarely stray from the bullet points and pseudocode theyre comprised of.I learned a lot during this course. Although, to gain confidence in your knowledge, this is a course that will require you to seek out additional materials to supplement your learning. Perhaps unsurprising being an introductory course, but the presenters struggle when faced with setting expectations.Throughout the course presenters often gloss over fairly complex concepts, treating them as they were trivial knowledge. This applies to mathematical definitions, proofs where most steps are skipped, tree diagrams without the context of their underlying theory, or bullet points used in place of what could be detailed explanations.All material is left equally weighted. Rather than providing explanations like: We dont need to go into detail on this, only x concept from it is important for what we want to focus on. Reference this chapter in this book for more detail. presenters would read mathematical definitions verbatim from the slides and move on. I was often unsure of how much I would need to know about such concepts.In terms of communication ability, the presenters dont hold up against many of the free/low-cost services Im accustomed to using, for example: MIT OpenCourseWare, Udacity, edX, Khan Academy, Code School, Treehouse, etc. Perhaps unsurprising, as these competing services often feature professional communicators rather than professional researchers. But the marketplace for quality online education is definitely becoming a competitive one. Users now expect nothing less than presenters with exceptional communication/teaching ability.In most videos the presenters read verbatim from the slides and motion with their hands to explain concepts that would be better broken down on a whiteboard. Rarely straying from the slides, the times the presenters go into more depth on a concept, you get a scribble in the corner of a slide, lacking the clarity Ive come to expect when approaching complex concepts from master educators like YouTuber PatrickJMT or Khan Academy. After a couple weeks into the course, I just went straight to the slides, read MITs Introduction to Algorithms, and skipped most of the course videos.But all things considered, the course served as a good curriculum to guide my focus through the introductory concepts, regardless of where I sought it out.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"About: First Lessons contain some Interface/Questionnaire errors.Hi, I reckon its a tad too early to rate this course since it is only going to start - but I didnt see another option to contact the Course Administrator other than trough the rating process.When going through the introduction of this course, there were multiple errors in the Quizzes/Q&As. EG: On a question with 1 correct answer, the solution page would also show the clearly wrong answers as correct (or correct, well done). There were several examples like this. It was only a bit confusing at start (this is my very first course on Coursera, maybe its common thing to happen.)There was also no option in these videos to thumb-up or -down vote, or to report a problem, like I had seen on other courses.In my opinion the videos were well spoken and easy to understand, and they included everything one could think of when first considering to start playing the guitar. Only the beginning of the first video had a slight feeling of Ok, Im a bit annoyed to do this now but that could easily be a misinterpretation or a strategy to capture interest. ;-)I do believe its a good thing that T. shows all the possible extras one can buy for a guitar, half of which no guitar player I know owns and which, all together would cost almost as much a beginner guitar, but I believe he omitted that guitar strings generally live longer when you clean the strings with a cloth where you touched them after playing. Thats a good maintenance practice if you cannot afford to buy 2 sets of strings every month.Maybe a good addition would be that guitars/instruments can also be rented for relatively cheap, instead of having to spend 500-1000 before even knowing what to look (listen) for when buying a guitar.To me the questions until now were a bit too easy but thats Ok. I might be studying with people half my age so thats fine. Especially the first questions should not be frightening but at least tickle your brain a little bit instead of just repeating a word from the video.Thank you very much for your consideration.

"This course has a lot of info to offer. The instructor is enthusiastic and provides lots of helpful links to articles, books, and resources that are really useful.

That said, I also dont think the current structure is ideal, because what youre learning is sometimes at odd with the structure of the assignments—for instance, a game design doc isnt finished until a game is nearly done while a prototype should come early in the process. So why does the game design doc assignment come before the prototype assignment?Also, while I appreciate that the instructor attempted to make the quizzes and grading more fun, the resulting options are often misleading or unclear. For example, the typical grading options are 1) You barely did it or didnt do anything, 2) You went above and beyond, and 3) This is pretty epic.

"I had no previous background in game theory before taking this course. I am an undergraduate physics major with the corresponding mathematical competence (up to multivariable calculus, differential equations, etc.), and an introductory course in Discrete Math. So I had seen the set theory and summation notation before, but had no experience applying them to game theory.The instructors were excellent and clearly have a deep academic background in the subject, as well as a significant personal interest. This is important because they didnt come off as if they were just relaying information; they gave the impression of genuinely enjoying the material and even going into brief interludes about the motivation behind some of the definitions and examples from their personal perspectives, in addition to the more standard lecture material.The course is definitely an introduction, and doesnt go into most of the more formal proofs of the theorems used, nor does it use examples or homework problems that require a significant background in the subject. I found I was able to complete most of the problem sets within 4-5 hours, with an average of about 3 hours. But your mileage on this may vary, especially if youre less familiar with the mathematical notation and the style of problem solving used. This is not to say the problems are not difficult, because they are! Many of them are non-intuitive and require you to think around corners, or consider methods of thinking and problem-solving that are not commonly used in math and the natural sciences. This, I think, is a byproduct of game theorys preeminent figure -- John Nashs -- unique approach to mathematics. He was famous for using highly intuitive, non-rigorous ways of coming to conclusions before proving them more formally. Thus, the field is a bit unconventional in its methods and approach, and wont be automatically accessible just because someone has already had exposure to advanced math or science. It requires time and careful thought to develop a deep understanding of. But I found that this effort was well rewarded by the end of the course where I started to see all the earlier theorems and techniques coming together to form a unified system of problem-solving capabilities.I strongly intend to take the advanced version of this course that is also offered on Coursera. As for this one, I recommend it to anyone interested in understanding the mathematics of games, competitive environments, and complex systems in general!

"Unfortunately as a course designed to teach Rails, it is poorly paced and has a few issues. The course content is spread out over three weeks as follows...Week 1 they go over setting up a Ruby on Rails development environment, which was fine. They also went over Git and Github. While you can access all of the course content on Github, you are never actually required to use Git for any of the work in the course, and it only shows up as a few questions on the only quiz in the course.Week 2 they cover Ruby programming and syntax. There are a lot of different sources where you can find tutorials and such for learning a new language, and in this course the material was... good enough. They also offered a number of practice assignments with self grading capability which is a nice feature.The graded programming assignment for week 2 gives a lot of information about how to set up your environment and steps/commenting to assist building out your code. However there were a few requirements for the graded portion of the assignment that they dont even tell you about (expected return values under certain situations) until you actually run the grader. They werent difficult but their reasoning were never explained in the course and it made the code a little more awkward than it needed be to pass.Week 3 is where the major pacing problems occur. There are a number of very broad stroke videos on Rails, as well as several brief videos covering a number of third party libraries or tools sometimes required to build Rail apps. A lot of the content they cover isnt even utilized in the assignments of the course.The week 3 assignment instructions are actually incomplete. They tell you a number of pre-required packages you have to install, including ones you had installed from previous assignments, but they leave out others you will need and leave several development environment issues you end up having to work out on your own.And where as the week 2 assignment was almost overly hand-holdy on showing you where in a ruby file structure to implement your code, week 3 hardly offers any guidance on where or how to implement your Rails structure. The broad stroke videos from week 3 kind of give you an idea as to what each piece of code is doing if your working from a template, but the assignment feels obfuscated when trying to build it from scratch.A major issue also comes from a third party website they require for completion of the assignment (and that requires separate registration to use). During several periods, over multiple sessions of the course, the third party site went down and was unavailable for as long as 48 hours at a time; during which it was impossible to properly run or debug the assignment due to its requirement.What the assignment is asking for isnt even terribly difficult when you do understand what is required, and the code is rather simple and minimal to implement. But you end up having to figure out a lot of that either off site (in which case you are not learning from the course) or by modifying a copy paste of some of the templates/scaffolding from the course GitHub content, in which case you dont get a good reinforcement of the material.In the end I wound up getting a certificate, feeling like I passed despite the course rather than because of it. There is some good foundation for a course in here, but it just falls apart in the third week and lacks any real depth.",0.0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0,0,1
"This course covers challenging technical topics and I appreciate that the effort that went into making it. That said I have serious concerns about the quality of execution for Part II of the course, which was much inferior to part I of the course.In general, the lectures themselves were up to the quality of part I and are well done. In many cases, the practice quizzes were less helpful. Including one sequence where each quiz extended the previous one but if you there was no way to learn from your errors, especially an error in the first quiz.For the peer graded assignments, there was one answer field for multiple questions, rather than one per question. Worse, the answers often required equations and LaTex math was not available. The only solution was to put the answers in a document on a cloud drive like Google Drive and paste a link in. Finally, for the peer review you could just mark questions correct or wrong with no way to provide private feedback on what was lacking in a response. Furthermore, doing the peer review was purely optional and the results were not actually scored. (Part 1 was similar, but it was possible to upload the document to Coursera directly and peer review was a required part of the course, resulting in a grade.) Either there are serious limitations with this iteration of the Coursera platform or the course authors did not understand how to properly implement this.Finally, in the session I took their was no active Teaching Assistance presence. There were no responses to student questions nor concerns that were raised about typos and possible errors in the quizzes and problem assignments. Either the course should not have been offered if no TA support was available or there should have been some notification in syllabus that this session would only have peer assistance with no support from the course staff.",1.0,0,1,1,1,1.0,0,0,1

"Actually, this course is a great one to take. Professors have explained these concepts and main ideas very clearly, therefore students can understand it very easily, even if they do not have previous knowledge about game theory. I want to say “thank you” to all the three professors for making such a concise and intelligible course.However, I would like to give some suggestions about this course. There is an obvious gap between the quizzes and graded assignments. Sometimes the quiz is very easy and it just requires you to have a basic understanding of the concept, while the assignment is even more difficult than the examples included in the videos. I think this course would be better if the staff can improve the difficulty gap between quizzes and assignments. And for people who want to enroll this course, an exercise book with detailed solution would be helpful for you to learn it better.As for the content of this course, there are lots of formulas from Week 5 to the end, which are a little difficult to understand. I fully understand this because math is always abstract, and formulation is an essential part of it. I think this problem can be solved by providing more ungraded quizzes for students to practice. They can have a better comprehension of the content through practicing.Anyway, this course is worth taking. Through learning it you will gain not only the knowledge about game theory, but also a new way to understand relationships around you. Happy learning!",1.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

I enrolled in the course simply because I felt it was time to take my love of the idea of learning and turn it into the practice of actually learning something.What I loved most about the course was Barbara Oakley herself and her inspiring story. I graduated from Oakland University with a bachelors degree in English. During those undergrad days, I often experienced the Impostor Syndrome. Discovering that there was an actual name for what I often felt, combined with the struggle to learn that Dr. Oakley experienced in her younger years, really connected with me. Thank you for sharing.One other note... I recently had the opportunity to share many of these ideas and concepts with my son who is a sophomore at Michigan State University. As Dr. Sejnowski mentioned in the final video, the measure of really knowing if youve learned something is to teach it to someone else.

"Taking this course in January/ February 2017, I found it to be jumbled, out-dated and frustrating.Materials are presented in a chaotic, roundabout way, which is neither chronological nor thematic, leaving huge lacunae. The initial lecture started with an entirely uncontextualised location-visit to Lewes, and mention of the Battle of Lewes in the Barons War, with plenty of merry jumping over the *rather more important* Magna Carta. In later lectures, there is similar dancing around the English Civil War, which is shocking, given its constitutional importance... and then lots of vague, hand-wavy references to European law. I understand that these lectures were filmed before last summers shock result in the EU referendum, but - honestly - would it have killed Professor Gearey to have discussed the context and possible implications of the referendum? By contrast, Im currently following a Futurelearn course which is a repeat iteration of the original material (thats how online courses are viable - I understand that) BUT which the educator cared about enough to updated with topical material from the very week in which we were following it (Week 1 of President Trump)!It would have been far better to have gone into the Common Law course with clear historical anchors (e.g. Magna Carta, Civil War, Great Reform Act, EU membership), which would have given a proper framework for studying the development of common law, through cases and precedent. Instead, we get Professor Gearey sliiiiiiding into half a dozen subjects per lecture and then leaving that question there for a later lecture.I must mention that other lecturer is much more coherent, and that he talks sensibly through various cases, actually demonstrating how precedent works. However, thats just not enough to make up for Professor Geareys flibbertigibbet style of exposition, which seems to make up the bulk of the course.On a technical level, the un-corrected transcripts of lectures were a huge headache, since they didnt make much more sense than the lectures themselves, and at times made even less sense, due to incorrect transcriptions. It was particularly frustrating to have legal references mis-spelled (e.g. Blackstone as Blackspen), making it difficult to track down better sources to supplement the lectures.I cant actually be bothered to see this course through to the end, and am very glad I didnt purchase it.",1.0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0,0,1

However, Part 3 includes six calculation questions unrelated to the project to be submitted in Parts 1 and 2.4- The forms of putting an answer are unclear, although it mentions how to put a percentage and two decimal points.5- Peer assessment take ages and is unnecessary.6- Discussion forums are deserted islands where no professional staff interaction is given.Ive stopped continuing this specialization and I strongly recommend others not to waste their time on it.",1.0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0,0,1
"I was not too fond of some of the comments/thoughts presented (ie. test gods, lady luck, that zombie talk, and the discreet mention of evolution as THE fact - referencing to Charles Darwin as some great intellect). To me that was drawing the idea that the Almighty Creator does not exist. But that is silly, given that only now we humans are just coming a tiny bit close to understanding how our brain works and how all the intricacies of the universe function - when He had that all figured out and established from the beginning.

"I took the Medical Neuroscience course as a way of getting a broad overview of the subject, and was not disappointed. The course starts with a solid basis in neuroanatomy, and builds in concepts and topics in a well structured way. The course seems to pursue two goals - on the one hand, to provide the basic neuroanatomy, physiology and functional background, and on the other to apply the knowledge to understand, identify and localize some medical conditions such as stroke, motor neuron disease, or Parkinsons Disease. The lab sessions and tutorials are entertaining and informative, thanks to Dr. Whites friendly and engaging presentation style. The tutorials are accompanied by useful notes, and the frequent quizzes support the learning of the very extensive material. His recommendations for learning the material (follow the path, visualize your knowledge, learn spatially and socially) are useful in many other contexts. The materials are supported by a reference texbook, Neuroscience 5th edition from 2012, and a new edition is expected in 2017. Also, the text transcriptions of the video presentations appear to have been generated by machine, and need to be proofread and corrected. In spite of this, they are very useful to review specific points in the videos. Although the course presents a huge amount of material and the discussion forums allow both clarification of issues and questions as well as deepening and extending the knowledge provided by the basic materials in the course.

"Probably the best MOOC course on Machine Learning. Professor Andrew Ng is a great teacher - he makes complex algorithms and concepts very lucid and easy to understand, especially for people with no ML/ AI background. The course is very well structured and gives useful practical tips. It does get quite intense at times, especially the vectorization parts in the programming assignments - but the Discussion Forums are a huge help. Many thanks to all the mentors, especially Tom Mosher for his guidance and valuable insights. Two small pieces of feedback -I ended up spending a lot more time on the programming assignments than on the videos themselves.The concepts were clear but the vectorization really made it very difficult to complete the assignments. Is it possible to use some other package instead of Matlab/ Octave, which is perhaps a little more high level and has functionality to do most of the stuff?The second suggestion/ feedback is : I found the time estimates to be very aggressive for a beginner with no ML/ Octave background. So, most of my study planning would routinely get off track. Not sure if most of the people taking this course found them to be OK.Is there a way to download Professor Ngs lecture notes for future reference? Not all the information is present on the slides. And it is difficult to bookmark videos - lecture notes would be a great help.All in all, this was a very interesting course - one I would recommend to colleagues and friends to take.

The course is helpful in providing a basic introduction to how data can drive better decision making in real business context. It provides a basic introduction to various tools and techniques.

"I will review this course appointing its pros and cons.Pros:- The instructor: he is a captivating person. It really seems that he like game development, he make jokes and try to make the course interesting. So, he’s personality is makes the course less boring.Cons:- The course name: when I saw “design” in the course name and the icon of course page, I thought it would be related to graphic design, or history telling and so on. But no, the “design” means “project”. So I think a better name would be “Principles of Game Project”. Although, it might be just me who thought this way, because in my language design means something totally different.- The course content: this course should be at the end of the specialization. It is too much abstract and, in some aspects, very obvious. I will not say it is completely useless, because it is not. It gives us a structured view of the stages of game design and its documentation, but I think it would be better if it was like a case study.- The assignments: probably the worst part of the course. They very very complex, to be sincere, none of the assignments I reviewed were full, I gave max grades to many because I think the person tried really hard to make it. Imagine this situation: you are not a programmer, not a graphic designer, not a writer and with a week you need to make a prototype of the game idea you’ve been working on course. This prototype must show the game mechanics and aesthetics, should be playable… And can be non digital? Come on, we are here learning the concepts of developments digital games and the instructor says that we can make a non digital prototype? Some people did it, and I can say for sure that I couldn’t imagine the real game. I made a digital prototype using the knowledge acquired from the first course, but as you can imagine, it is not enough to make our game ideas come true.- The peer review system: the grading is completely non sense, as I said before, the assignments are complex, so it is difficult to show our ideas clearly in a document, without the abilities to make concept arts or something. In 2 of the 4 assignments 2 of the 3 people gave me max grades and 1 gave me bad grades, and did not left any feedback! One of the assignments when I first submitted it I got 12/20. Then, when I resubmitted it, without changing a comma, I got 20/20. So I think this system must change, maybe the mentor should do it.If you want to do all the specialization, ok, go and do this course.

"I am afraid this is going to be a rather negative review. Having completed over 10 Coursera courses over the year, and numerous other online classes, this is officially the worst. For me personally, the whole course was a complete waste of time. Put it simply, the presenter cant teach, at least not the MOOCs. There were no structure. The instructions were all over the place, and explanations were inadequate. After drumming how important to actually code, he proceeded to present the whole lecture showing small pieces of codes.... on slides. After touting how cool and useful Sublime is as a developer tool, he didnt even use it. After telling everyone how useful regular expression is but not part of this course (so he wont explain), he went on to use regular expressions for all the sample codes for the rest of the lecture. As mentioned, there was no structure as to how he present Ruby/Rails as a programming platform. It was bits of code here, bits of code there. Beside getting a feel of what Ruby syntax is like, there was no learning. I am aware there are suggested readings, but then why doing this MOOC at all.As I check out other courses from the same Ruby specialization, the student numbers are getting smaller. Hardly everyone post on the forums, I also check the Classmates map. I suspect many simply gave up since the Intro classes were so bad.

"Good intro - Im learning a lot. But in the end I feel that this specialization is not focused enough on developing portfolio pieces. One portfolio piece at the end of an 8-month course does not seem adequate to me. So I wish we focused more on developing high fidelity work - in addition to the need-finding, user research, sketches, short weekly assignments. This high fidelity, digital work could even be optional, but I need some guidance on what work to develop and how the overall process should look.Or even being allowed to enroll in the capstone before completing the first 7 sections would be helpful.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"Would have preferred if there were programming assignments that incorporated reading from data sources on the web.For those planning to take the course, note the following:*The course covers reading data from a myriad of sources, but largely in passing superficial detail. These sources include XML files, mySQL databases, HDF5 files, csv files, txt files with various formats (for example fixed-with files), JSON objects, and web API.However, the course project only involves reading data from several txt files and combining them into a single R dataset.Course topic order: In the first two weeks of the course, a lot of information is glossed over in passing- this information involves reading from the various file formats mentioned above. Week 3 involves subsetting, sorting, reshaping and merging data. Some of this may be review for you if youve taken the R programming course or the R Programming Environment course in the Mastering Software Development in R specialization. Week 4 involves string manipulation, regular expressions and working with the Dates. A lot of this is covered in Roger Pengs ebooks R Programming for Data Science and Mastering Software Development in R (both are freely available- google them).Assessments: The only assessments in the course are 4 quizzes- each of which involves about 5 short programming exercises- and a final project which only involves topics from weeks 3 and 4 (specifically- subsetting data, sorting data, reshaping data, and working with regular expressions). So you can do the course project without understanding anything covered in weeks 1 and 2 of the course.Mentor David Hood is fantastic for providing valuable resources to aid you with each assessment and so is Xing Su for providing a complete set of course notes.

"My review concerns partially the course and partially the Coursera concept as this was my first on-line course and I cannot distinguish between those two.My experience was simply great, I felt that it was time well spend, for example compares to my company provided trainings and Im hoping to return to another course.I have quite strong background in statistics so some parts were too basic for me but being able to speed the videos up is neat and it opens the course to wide spectrum of students (again opposed to company provided trainings or even school lessons where in the best case half of the students are bored of the slow tempo and other half isnt able to keep up with the same tempo). To have my own timeplan also helps but I even finished quite early as it was so fun.About the course contend: Andrew Ng prepared great lessons, all was pretty well explained (even when he cannot use some advanced math not to lose part of the students). The examples were illustrative as well as realistic (at least seemed realistic and that makes it more exciting than some artificial ones).I was little afraid of the programming exercises as Ive never worked with Matlab (using mainly R). But now Im glad that I know another language:) The system of submitting works perfectly.I can say similar thinks about the contend of the exercises as I wrote about examples in lectures. It is nice to program my own spam filter - the concept of programming only some small parts of the program and not to have to deal with data loading, plotting... is again very entertaining and instructive and then it can be done some nice application in short time.My thanks to the whole Coursera team and of course Andrew Ng.

Some weeks take longer than other weeks, and you dont really know until the week starts. One thing I really dislike is you cant take notes online while watching the video.
