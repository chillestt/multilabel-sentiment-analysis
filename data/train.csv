"This course was very nicely done. Dr Ngs videos and narrative were excellent. They were long enough to convey the material properly and short enough not to loose my attention. Assignments were very good as they left you just enough room to fail, learn and ultimately succeed. The quizzes were thought provoking. On the questions that stated choose all that apply, I would suggest that some form of feedback be provided so that the test taker could know which ones were incorrectly selected/not selected. Perhaps partial credit would be good instead of 0/20 with one wrong selection. Feedback, perhaps an explanation, would be appropriate on all questions incorrectly answered.I would also suggest a pdf document that showed how to do the various matrix operations in octave with an example or two. This would include basic and advanced operations. I know linear algebra, I just didnt know the syntax in octave and this cost me 3-5 hours over the whole course.Now off to do some simple applications here at work like spam filter and anomaly detection to start.

"She didnt seem interested at all in what she was teaching. She had a frown the entire time. Maybe she was trying to be professional?

They are generally good social skills that every one should have. I learned little to nothing while taking this class. But, as I said, most of this is directed towards to someone in a management position. I guess this would be helpful when having to work with someone who is a drama-maker, although, fortunately, I have not had a situation yet with someone who creates drama.

Good coverage in a very fast intro to the subject. Definitely take away some things I am able to put into use in my work. I get the feeling this is quite a new course (compared with the very well established Data Science Specialization) and does not have the student interaction base yet.

"The content of this course is interesting, I liked the examples, and the material gave an interesting overview of different aspects of machine learning. From that perspective, the course is as advertised. But, where this course goes wrong is value for money - it is very superficial and not worth what is charged.As noted by others, this is not a course for learning so much as an advertisement for the instructors own pay software and their other Coursera courses. Im not against that per say if it was entirely free, but charging for an advertisement is ridiculous. In my case I thankfully started with the free model so I didnt lose out, but I could see others being dissapointed. I strongly recommend starting the material with a free signup and only pay if you really want the extra grading.My other main problem was with the pace and detail in the course. I would have liked more detail, but I recognize this was intended to be a high level view so Ill live with that level of detail. The material covered, however, does not need 6 weeks worth of lectures. This course could be ~1/2 as long, cover the same material, and be a MUCH better course.Other small problems include some poorly edit videos (there are a lot of examples of simple stumbling in the videos that should have meant they do another take), very short videos (maybe a person preference, but the number of <2 minute videos here is annoying, especially when theres a 5-second standard video at the start and end of all videos). All in all, theres just a lot of wasted time.When signing up for this course I was really excited for the entire specialization - now, not so much. Ill probably try the second course in the series (for free to start) to see if things improve, but ironically this advertisement video has if anything turned me off their other products.",1.0,0,1,1,0,0.0,0,0,1

"Thank you, Dr. Chamovitz! I enjoyed this course. I did WAPK 1 a few years back as well. Please do create many more courses on plant biology - yours is the only one available on Coursera. Some feedback points: 1) Very little interaction and moderation on the discussion forums. There are many interesting points posted there, but no instructor intervention. 2) After listening to the videos i really did not enjoy the reading material provided - perhaps some other sites would be better. 3) The course syllabus is not enough to gauge whether the course is basic, medium or advanced level. Perhaps an indicator would help. For example, in Week 3 content on photosynthesis I was expecting a much more detailed discussion. It would be great to have more advanced courses from you and your team. Your overview explanations are extremely lucid and the visuals provided really help. I think that very few biology textbooks/reading material provide such a clear overview picture and link across concepts. Excellent course! 4) The concern re. GMOs is just touched upon - in such a case I think it would be good if you could take up specific queries, concerns raised in different countries and share your view on those.

"When the heck do you actually start programming? Its just him explaining and explaining and explaining and explaining. I did a little course work where I programmed some simple console applications like talking about my name and favorite games, but then he drones on for hours and hours about concepts without actually putting them to practice. He jumps through parts that could have otherwise given valuable information and experience like creating the deck class. Nope, he just has it all premade for you. The course stresses Youll need to program a lot to gain experience, so youll be doing it a lot of programming in this course. - but Im not, theres no programming at all. Its just droning on and on about concepts and how they work.Yes its important to learn what these things do, but its much more important to put them to practice.

"It was by far the best course Ive taken on Coursera. For someone not dealing with math in their everyday life it could have been a bit challenging, but I really enjoyed watching how math, physics and neuroscience use the same concepts and how various models can be interchangeable.Main subject was super-interesting, but I also enjoyed how it showcased how mathematical concepts can be used and applied. Its really disappointing that such approach is not that common in formal education many of us have received... For such interesting topics you presented I would go back to university and learned differential equations once again, seeing some purpose in them at last. I always knew that mathematics is a beautiful language, but during my education no-one showed me such profound and exciting problems to express them in it.The instructors were great and guest lectures were fun as well.

"Whilst the material in the course is fine (although repetitious in places), the pacing is fairly poor.Ultimately, there are three things covered by this course: a brief overview of remote sensing, hands-on raster classification and hands-on work with Model Builder work (using hydrology as an example framework). These then combine into the final submitted assignment. Many of the remaining lecture topics dont particularly link in to anything youll be doing and are just for interests sake. Also, a lot of time is spent on the more intuitive aspects of Model Builder, but little to none is allotted to troubleshooting and the less intuitive aspects (for example, how to incorporate variables throughout a model or other issues with generalising a custom tool built within Model Builder).If taking the course, be aware that the final submitted assignment requires formulating your own research question and unless youre already working in the field, can necessitate a significant amount of literature review for even the given example research questions. The gap in expectations and assistance is more of a chasm.Unless you have the better part of a week free to commit to the course, it is advised that you skip ahead to the final assignment immediately and spread it over the full four weeks, spending the first week formulating the question, the second producing the classified raster and the third the model builder model, including any research necessary for this step. This gives the last week to produce products for submission or continue the work from the third week.Hopefully in upcoming repeat sessions of the course, pacing will be improved, the grading rubric provided before final submission for the sake of transparency and clarity, and a little more guidance and actual feedback available in the forums, which are largely deserted at this point.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"I´m quite disappointed in this course. First you should know that the first week doesn´t reflect at all the rest of the course in difficulty and in matter. As I was delighted by the first week presentation and way of explaining as soon I started the second week I was wondering what happen to the clear, concise examples and ideas presented in the first one. First The presentation of the following weeks is done by handwriting on software that give a very very poor graphic view. It´s BARELY READABLE ! It allows really smalls amounts of infos to be displayed. That could be redeemed by good explanations you may say but sadly it´s not the case most of the time. The examples are rarely connected to something real, numbers come up from ... nowhere. The level of difficulty could be challenging if you don´t have a bachelor of sciences like Math or Physics or Bio. It´s NOT A BEGINNER COURSE.To give more context I have done and succeed more 16 courses , 2 specializations, followed/audited about 3 others courses and that is the first time I´m giving a bad review. I´m sure the teachers put a lot of effort in doing the course , there is a lot subjects presented but I definitely suggest a change in the presentation to start then connect and fully explain examples.

"There are a number of issues with this course, and more generally Coursera. While the course does cover the material, it uses non-standard mathematical notation. This can be very confusing and seems as if it is purposefully so. There are several mathematical abstractions used that perhaps have a purpose in later machine learning applications but seem unnecessary here.Another issue is that the course assumes the use of Octave which is not available for Windows users apparently. It also allows the use of MatLab but the quiz questions are in Octave which means the quiz is not necessarily testing understanding of the course material as it is Octave.Generally, the opportunities for feedback to Coursera are highly limited. A colleague once took a course online (through another platform). Some of the course material was objectively wrong. However, there was no ability to submit feedback. I have the sense that this could easily happen with the Coursera material. It totally undercuts the apparent validity of the platform.",0.0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0,0,1

"Positive points:-this really is a beginners course, without any knowledge about coding or the syntax of MATLAB necessary.-you learn by solving the problems yourself. This gives you great insight about the thought processes necessary, about different approaches and how to realize your ideas.-Mentors are responding quickly (sometimes within a half hour) and are doing there best to help you out.Negative points:-The video lectures, although informative have a very slow paste and the earlier ones do not prepare you that well for the homework assignments. However once you get used to it you will manage to get an idea about the assignments from the lectures. Still the same problem is illustrated way too often in the same lecture. One could either add different problems or shorten the lectures a lot. With time it is possible to learn when one can skip a section but it makes it especially hard for people to start the course, since one spends hours watching videos for just learning about basic syntax in the beginning- For some of the homework assignments the mathematical part was the bigger challenge for me than the coding part, which is really frustrating when you just want to learn how to code.",0.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

This is a very unevenly paced and constructed course - not at all delivered to the standard of the previous Coursera courses I have followed. Some lectures are clear and guide the learner step by step - and then others suddenly assume a level of knowledge and sophistication that is at a significantly higher level and includes concepts that have either not been introduced or have been dealt with in minimal detail. It also ends up focusing more on music analysis than music theory - while there is a relationship between these 2 approaches I did not embark on this course to become an analyst - as a practising musician I wanted to understand more of the concepts behind what I do and hear.

"I will give it a 4, but 3.5 would be my review if the 3.5 mark would be available.Strenghts of the course: Solid and elegant presentations, good readings, and the interviews presented with the ICJ judge and the PCA secretary added value.Weakeness and Opportunites: No slides, excessivelly short course in video resources (discounting the interviews, it had about 20-40 minutes of videos, what is clearly insuficient, when benchmarking with other offerings in the MOOC arena) and allowing quizzes to be taken on a 2x per hour is not in my opinion adequate. It makes it too easy and fast to finish the course and does not create an incentive to review the materials. Leiden should focus in presenting more specializations in the educational fields that it has reputation - Law, Tax Law, International Studies, in order to capture more value from the current lack of offerings of specializations in that niche markets.Threats: There is a lot of offerings on the MOOC space, with a finite time availability to make choices.

Besides the videos only showed the formulas with no example at all! Very disappointed with the course...

"Enjoyed week 1, looking forward to week 2. Believe my review will be five stars by the end of the course. Am interested in taking more MOOC like this in philosophy.Enjoyed week 2, looking forward to week 3 and starting Ancient Philosophy: Aristotle and His Successors. I like the lecture style and can tell Susan really enjoys teaching the subject.Enjoyed week 3, looking forward to week 4. So far, Plato and Socrates make much more sense to me than Aristotle but I have only done week 1 of Ari. Perhaps Ari mellows a bit as he gets older, lets hope so. ~(B-)Just finished week 4, great course. Only sorry that I couldt give it six stars. I read that Socrates was married to a bit of a dragon who kicked him out of the house every day, either to get a real job or so he wouldnt get under her feet while she was doing the housework. So, Philosophy could have started as an alternative to drink or hanging round the bookies all day? Mind you, the drink still got to him in the end. No wonder his decision to go for the Hemlock was taken so quickly. Wonder why Socrates didnt ask other Athenians why they got married? If he had all other philosophers since may have been singles with no advice for the rest of humanity on the what, why, when, who, where, when, and how of the logic of the process. Perhaps Aristotle may have the answer? See you all on the next stage down the road to discovering the Meaning of Life. T.T.F.N.",0.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

"This course has great potential as it is an extraordinarily timely topic, domestically and globally. The accessible required reading assignments were thought provoking and topical.

Also - the second course in the series which Im taking now is taking what we did in course 1 and diving into the math and algorithms involved - walking through actual proofs etc. It doesnt require you to know them well enough to do on your own, but they do walk you through them and explain extremely well - you actually implement the resulting algorithms.

I really liked Karls casual and somewhat spontaneous style - this is a breath of fresh air from the video tutorials out there where lecturers are reading from prompts or reciting from memory.The biggest drawback to this course is that it relied completely on peer grading for the assessment (which you have to pay for). I dont think this assessment method was sufficiently designed to reduce the influence of graders who were overly subjective, hadnt sufficiently mastered the content themselves, or were disinterested in putting effort into the peer review. From now on, I will think twice about paying for any course where all of the assessment is based on how my classmates grade me. While peer review can be useful for learning, I dont think its an accurate assessment tool.

So I appreciate having access to this course.Classification and organization of detailed and complex material is well organized. Great work amassing and presenting knowledge of contemplative practices.I feel there was some repetition or redundancy, but in my case that was not necessarily a bad thing, other than to add to the mass of information being delivered. The repetition helped to stabilize my memory and helped to establish a baseline of concepts from which to build my understanding.I became mired in detail, but absorbed as much as I could in lieu of being able to recall consciously specific pieces of information. I dont want to judge the presenters by suggesting that they tried to put too much information into too little of a space. I found my efforts to absorb the info meditative in nature, thus I welcomed the challenge.The videos of presenters reading texts of detailed and dense info was difficult to follow at times, but I discovered that it helps, in some cases, to download the script of the talks and follow along with the video as I read the script.The focus on history and historical debates and conflicts between shamatha and vipassana practices, etc., within Buddhism were helpful but not as key as the meditation practices. I suppose it is difficult to separate them since they are so entwined.I have learned a lot more than I ever expected when I began this course.I value discussions and sharing among students, but the course is so dense and time consuming that I had no time left to participate in sharing with others.

"Ive been developing in imperative languages for the past 10 years, and my motivation for taking this course was to make sure that I was using the functional capabilities of the language.While Ive embraced immutability and higher-order functions since I started writing Scala, I havent solved significant programming challenges using functional thinking. Much of what Ive already done with Scala so far has been relatively stateless request-response communication between systems, and the challenges so far tend to be on the architecture end.This first course taught me useful things that I hadnt encountered in my industry use of Scala. It has given me greater appreciation for the design of the language and the problems that Scala can solve elegantly. Ive also acquired more interest in learning about more functional approaches to various problems -- perhaps Ill dig deeper into SICP at some point!The assignments were a good fit for me -- they were challenging enough that they got me to think but not so hard that I got stuck. Scalas rich type system came in handy for the assignments -- once youve got the right idea for an approach, you just have to get the data structures to click (with some help from the compiler), and things just work!I appreciate that the assignments and examples were realistic. Getting to implement Huffman Coding and basic data structures (functional and OO sets) helped me both appreciate the functional way to solve problems like these, and to understand the class of practical problems where similar solutions are applicable.Great course, and Im excited for the next ones!

That is a trait I have seen for the first time on Coursera, and I have to give Dr. Chagpar high praise in these terms. The only things I did not like - which are very small in contrast to the things I did like - were that she taught a bit as though she was teaching to 6th graders, rather than seasoned adults.

"The course provides a solid structure on which to build academic essays. The content of the videos is generally good and seems appropriately targeted but the sample essays are disappointingly trivial (and not terribly well written). They seem more suited to young High School students rather than would-be college level writers.The big issue is in the peer assessment process which forms the centre of the practical experience in the course. There is a tremendous time lag apparent between essays being submitted and being reviewed. Mine took between 3 and 4 weeks to get through the process. This is obviously an issue for Coursera to address as it relates to the platform design rather than the course team but it is nevertheless frustrating.There is a big disconnect between the standards the instructors seem to expect and the assignments submitted. The vast majority of students clearly do not have English as a first language and for many writing an academic essay is really some way ahead of their current position. Perhaps more disturbing is that most of the (apparently) native English speakers seem not to have taken any notice of either the lectures or the peer grading rubrics.Despite the shortcomings in the peer review process the material is well presented and offers a strong framework around which students can build good effective essays.Once again, the lack of a forum in this course makes life unnecessarily difficult and frustrating and for me pushes my rating down from a low 4 to 3 stars.",1.0,0,0,1,1,1.0,0,0,0
"I did not have a lot of experience in machine learning, so this course was very good in the aspect of introducing people to machine learning concepts. Most of the times the material was very well explained, and I like the concept of the tutor writing on the screen at the same time they are presenting, personally it helps me more. Some of the quizzes were easy so you did not need a lot of preparation, some of them were more difficult or troublesome, like the quiz for Deep Learning. I also liked the graphlab module, I think that learning how to use it will help me with my own work.However, as this course does not really go in depth in the algorithms themselves, I feel that after one month and a half I have a basic idea, but I havent learned much about how to implement machine learning on my own even in basic things, while other courses have more or less the same time frame and are more dense in their material. In my opinion, this whole introductory course would just be just splitted and each of these intrductory weeks would be appended as the first week of the subsequent modules to come. Because anyways, after 4 months in the specialization, if somebody continues to the recommender systems module for example, he/she would have forgotten the basics of this so they would need to cover again the recommender systems week in this course.

"The course starts very promising, but it gets worse week after week, culminating on a barely understandable week about dynamic programming. That’s when I gave up and decided to write this review instead, with just one assignment missing to complete the course.Some of the teachers aren’t native english speakers, which is fine, but their english is very hard to understand. I found myself having to watch some portions of the videos over and over again in order to understand what was being said. I tried reading the transcripts instead, but the they’re even worse! It seems that they were automatically generated from the videos, thus suffering with the poor pronunciation.The teachers use mathematical sophistication that feels unnecessary, but to be fair, they do mention it on the FAQ as part of the necessary background. However, even though it’s an online course, they barely use any teaching method besides very raw slides, some dry mathematical proofs and someone speaking about the content.

"The videos are quite interesting, though I think they are overly committed to very specific techniques. I did not, however, find the assignments and peer review system very helpful.

There also does not seem to be enough people to review all of the assignments, either--perhaps due to the paywall for assignments. The very nature of the peer review system also guarantees you see a real range on the individual criteria you are evaluated on and the depth of the review. This exacerbates the very harsh 0 or 1 point option for all assignments (i.e. either you get a 1 and pass or you get a 0 and fail).Bottom line: I think the course materials are useful and at the very least interesting for developing writers, but Im not sure its worth the $79 entry fee to gain access to the peer review, unless you really need or want the course certificate.",1.0,0,1,0,0,1.0,0,0,0

"Overall this class was a good starting point for basics of finance, but coming from an Ivy League school it could stand a bit more polish and professionalism, especially if Yale University expects people to pay for the class and their accreditation.The instructor has an odd speech manner which takes a little bit of time to get used to, but doesnt detract from the material.The tests are not difficult but the questions are often poorly phrased, such as questions that ask you what a certain term of art is while none of the answer choices are descriptions of the term of art and the correct answer is an application of the term that does not actually answer the call to question.Most of the videos are cobbled together excerpts from lectures the professor previously gave. As such they cut out randomly, have issues with the sound volume, and often discuss material that was cut out prior to the section or should come later, but never does. Not the biggest problem once you get used to it, because the course is an overview, but its still kind of annoying and not very professional compared to other courses available.The instructor is clearly very pro-capitalism, which is a mixed bag. On one hand hes very knowledgable and communicates a lot of really good information. On the other hand hes also very clearly biased bordering on utopic about the benefits of capitalism and glossing over a lot of the down side risks that are inherent in finance. To be clear this criticism is not of the Professor, or to say that down side risk and risk management are not sufficiently discussed, but merely that IMHO the course could benefit from more discussion and material on the negative aspects/ramifications of unfettered capitalism, especially given the large amount of time spent discussing the 2008 recession.All that being said, I learned a lot from this course and found it very interesting and informative.

Very minor thing, but as the course was so good otherwise it stuck out to me. In my case, I got contradicting scores (low DC, high maximizer) and the following discussion mostly addressed the overly controlling case.

"There are several things in the course that were able to clear up my understanding. The course instructor responds to more questions than I would have expected as well.

The course covers conjugate priors for several different likelihoods including the normal distribution and the binomial distribution.

"Ive been to college, so Im not the target audience for this course, but I was curious to see what would be covered and to learn more about colleges today.

I wished Id known more about this when I started college. Of course I knew they did research, but I thought they were primarily there to teach. This is true at some colleges, but at others, the amount and quality of research can determine whether a professor gets to continue working there and reach tenure. So teaching may not be the first priority for some professors. Students may find that chunks of courses are devoted to a professors research interests, which could enrich or derail the course. This could have been covered in more depth.Other things that could have been covered: why some courses are so large and the function of recitation sections and graduate teaching fellows for those and smaller courses; what a seminar is; the existence of course reviews that can help with selecting classes and professors; how to deal with not getting into a course you really need to take (wait lists, professorial overrides, etc.); when pre-requisite courses are really necessary and when theyre just recommended; dropping courses; GRADES (how the college grading system works, what happens when you fail a course, academic probation, earning honors); campus codes of conduct (greater freedom as with class attendance; smoking and drinking rules, harassment policies) and disciplinary actions (disciplinary probation, expulsion); good campus activities for shy students.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"This course has valuable information, but it is ultimately political. The professors dont even disclose that there are two opposing historical schools: New Historians, whom Palestinians reference; and traditional historians, favored by most Israelis. Which version is followed here? The answer is a mix, without identification. This is not the same as balance, which would entail each side laying out its key points and evidence. As others note, there is zero reading material. One wonders if this is because to choose a historian is to choose sides--that is how divisive this topic is. The discussion forums are also poorly monitored, unlike other Coursera courses; which does not advance understanding.A little knowledge is a dangerous thing unfortunately applies to this condensed intro course. And contrary to expectations for an offering from Tel Aviv U., most Israelis would likely be offended by some of its assertions/omissions. For example, Israelis recall that Palestinian founding father Haj Amin al-Husseini was a Nazi agitator in Europe and bequeathed an anti-Jewish ideology (Netanyahu even made a speech about this in 2015 that was covered internationally).

Why 5 stars:1. The amount of effort to put the course together is evident.

"This is a great course to have available. However, I do think that in order to truly grasp many of the concepts, you need to either have a good baseline statistical background (ie, more than one college stats course), or be willing to spend a lot more time looking up many of the concepts (though many can only be found referenced in papers). For those who are engaged in applied statistics/signal processing, this would probably be fine. The course was very interesting, but I do wish they spent a bit more time breaking down the statistical measures and more examples/figures/analogies to make the course overall more coherent, and encourage a deeper understanding from a big picture perspective.

"This capstone project was a huge disappointment to me. The course caption stated that this would be where we would use Location, Design and Usability, and Persistence and Settings to build a high quality app. Also stated is that you’ll apply your skills to create a fully-functioning photo editing app for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Earlier I have also read that we would be allowed to build an app of our choice or according to teachers specification. That text now seems to have been removed.Anyway, none of these promises were kept. Instead we got something like 20 minutes of lectures in total for the whole four weeks, all on a simple framework to track face features. Unfortunately this framework isnt very competent, so theres only so much you can do with it. Most of us have only placed some static images and simple animations on top of the face shown in the camera view, and that is actually enough to get full marks according to the form used in the peer review. How does that even begin to fulfil the promises of the caption?We have paid as much for this course as for the previous three. There should of course be a similar amount of lectures on more advanced topics like current best practises for UI design, the Location API which was promised, and other interesting things that provide the building blocks for a state of the art iOS app. For a real cornerstone project, I expect that more than 4 weeks would be necessary in order to be able to build a good app, since many of us are doing this on our spare time.I feel sad that I had the misfortune of signing up for this course before it was made, but hope that you will take our collective criticism and make a good course out of this for future students.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"Excellent coverage of algorithmic techniques in this course, with very accessible introductions to such fundamental topics as the Master Method, greedy algorithm design, and dynamic programming. This class hits the sweet spot for people who find Tim Roughgardens Analysis and Design of Algorithms course too intense and hand-wavy, but who still want mathematically-sound, proof-based discussion of algorithmic techniques. (Listen to Roughgardens drive-by treatment of Karatsubas algorithm in his first week of lectures, and you will appreciate Neil Rhodes coverage of the same algorithm all the more.) You get an introduction to a lot of greatest hits from Computer Science, but at a level where you come away understanding the technique. The problem sets start off with fairly easy exercises, just enough to reinforce your understanding, and progress up to exercises that will prove challenging indeed to newcomers. You will get a lot out of careful study of this course. I look forward to continuing in this specialization.",0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1,0,0
"Sorry to say that this is the worst Coursera Course I have ever taken, and Ive taken quite a few. The instructors did not do a good job at explaining how to use Wordpress. They didnt explain how to use wordpress to make a website that looked more like a website than a blog. They didnt explain the difference between wordpress.com and wordpress.org even though they mentioned them both. They talked about hosting but didnt explain how to do it. They mentioned hosting on bluehost but didnt give any instructions. The few tidbits of information that they did give about using wordpress were so brief with no examples. They mentioned Jetpack but didnt say what it was. They didnt explain what benefit adding the social media icons would have or how to link them.

"a) There clearly was a huge amount of criminal behavior that contributed to the crisis. The presenters appear to approach the subject half-heartedly, and focus their energies on disproving the possibility without sufficiently examining it.b) A lot of the review questions focus on remembering facts rather than on understanding the causes and effects. For example, what is the relevance of being able to remember that job losses at the height of the crisis were of the order of 880k a month or 200k a month??c) It is obvious to anyone with even trivial financial expertise that the financial system today is weaker than it was before the crisis. The too big to fail are bigger today (by a large margin) and interest rates are too low (remember the search for yield was the motivation for the creation of the exotic securities which blew up the system).

It was very hard to see what notes were being hit by the mallets (especially when using chords) and therefore it was very difficult to understand (visually) what Gary was doing. I suggest using a keyboard and having the camera shooting from the above of the keyboard (look at how several people have done this on YouTube).

I chose to use 2 shapes, but multiple counts and some people that thought this is not only 2 shapes, but 2 counts as well, chose to grade my work with the lowest rating due to unfulfilled assignment.

"This is one of the best course related to computer programming that I came across. All the concepts are very well explained. Homework assignments are very much challenging. If you are a beginner, completing the homework assignments will take lot of time and will sometimes be frustrating. However, forums will be one of your best asset while completing this course. All the mentors and Instructors answer to all your concern. They will not give you the exact code for your answer, but they will guide you so that you can solve the questions. Some of the questions will be tough and may take days for you to figure out(speaking out of my own personal experience), but keep posting in the forums. So, if you are going for the course certificate then be prepared for the effort and time that will be used up to complete the Home work assignments. A good time will be to learn in your vacations, but dont stress yourself while your college is going on.Since this was only an introduction to MATLAB, you will not be learning how to create GUIs and entire softwares. Also, if you are looking forward to know how to use MATLAB on some hardwares, then you are not going to find it in this course. However, if you ask the mentors where to learn those things from, they will guide you. They also have a textbook available for the course, but I completed the course very well without it. So, its not a compulsion, but I am going to buy it so that I have a better understanding about how to create GUIs for the code that I type.Tl;dr: This is the best course if you are a beginner and have no experience in programming, but if you are an expert programmer, you might get bored with some initial topics, but later things do start to get interesting. Also, you need to dedicate your time and effort to complete Home work assignment.",0.0,0,1,0,0,1.0,0,0,0

"This course, which sounds promising in title and syllabus, has many glaring deficiencies. In fact, I feel terrible if anyone ponied up $100+ for it. It roughly covers some concepts of data science, but never at scale, and never very clearly. My background is a science Ph.D. with a lot of computational science experience.The lectures: Clearly poorly planned. Bill Howe has some knowledge about databases, but little skill in communicating it. The organizational structure leaves much to be desired. Much of the lectures are broad-brush and halting, simultaneously being too detailed as times and not broad enough at other times. Technical portions are marked by a number of errors in speaking and on the slides, as well as a lot of hesitation and jargon. Its as if he neither thought about the structure of what he wanted to say or a script of what he might say prior to recoding the session. Phoning in it is an apt description.The Assignments: The first assignment with Twitter was fun and interesting and gets the course 2 stars instead of one. The lectures prior to this will not prepare you for the assignment though, so might as well just skip them and do it on your own. The SQL assignment followed a set of lectures in which no proper discussion of SQL was ever given. The last assignment on Map-Reduce is acceptable although a number of errors in the homeworks are still uncorrected long after the first offering of this course. The autograders idea of helpful feedback is similar to Incorrect value. Try again Week 4 of this course, which contains a vast amount of information has no exercises at all.Overall, this class is the polar opposite of a quality online course like Andrew Ngs Machine Learning Course. Do the twitter assignment and skip the rest. Lectures are poor and assignments are well below average.

"This is my feedback as a Beta-Tester for the course:Week 1I thought that the videos were clear, well organized and flowed well from topic to topic. There was a clear logic as the professor developed the various ratios.What was missing for me was some in-line quizzes. Not the “tell me what I just told you type” but rather ones that make you think. So, for example, in the final video for Week 1, the optional video, instead of just suggesting that the students “play” with the spreadsheet, I think it would be better to give them an actual task or two… “change the assumption about X to <this value>. What is the impact on the Y ratio? Why?” I liked that he showed what numbers needed to be changed to make the share valuation closer to $55. But rather than just telling us the answer, this would be another opportunity to have the students stop the video and go try it themselves. With a specific task, it is likely that more students will go and work with the spreadsheet. This is where the real learning takes place.One of the things that I really liked about the design of prior courses by Professor Bushee was the fact that he had examples throughout the videos that had you apply the information right away. But, perhaps this is just me. I know that I learn a lot better by doing rather than just watching the videos and going “yeah… that makes sense. I understand…” I also recognize that some students, in past courses, have probably said they don’t find the in-line quizzes valuable. But, is that a reflection of the value of in-line quizzes as a whole or just in-line quizzes that simply require “parroting” something said in the video.I’m sure that the professor can come up with lots of examples. In Week 1 Video 1 the in-line quiz might provide some numbers for De-levered Net Income, Sales, Average Total Assets and Average Shareholder’s Equity and asking for the results of each of the ratios in the Dupont Analysis. And maybe a “think about what this means” type question that is not necessarily “marked” but for which an answer is provided in the video. Alternatively, he could have the students change some specific things in the Woof Junction spreadsheet and indicate what impact that has on the ratios and why.Week 1 Video 2 offers lots of similar opportunities with the Profitability and Turnover Ratios. Perhaps requiring the students to work backwards from a specific ratio to determine gross profit would be effective. Or, perhaps a question that relates strategy specifically to the ratios. For example, what would happen to the Gross Margin if Woof introduced a credit card and days receivable increased to 31.6 in 2015? Just something to engage people with the materials.All of the videos offer similar opportunities and I think having specific problems or questions will enhance the learning experience rather than just suggesting that they “go look at the spreadsheet”. The audience for these courses tends to be quite a bit different from your average upper tier university student and probably needs a bit more “hand holding” and “direction” in order to be successful.Also, if Professor Bushee expects students will watch the optional videos anyway, why make them optional? In the case of the Valuation Video, despite some of the mathematics being a little “scary” for some students, I think that the information there is really useful and helps to solidify an understanding of the spreadsheet.I’m wondering if an in-quiz question would be helpful. Perhaps it might provide a new set of financials for Woof Junction and ask for ratio calculation and what that means in terms of their position in the marketplace or something similar. Just some practice questions to get people working with the information.Same comments basically apply for the remainder of the weeks. I think that it would help the students to have some in-line quizzes – this not only breaks up the longer videos and helps to keep students focused but also provides a reinforcement of key concepts.I really liked the quiz for Week 1 even though I struggled with the questions where there are multiple correct responses. The quiz effectively reinforces the information covered very well and requires one to think about what was covered in the lectures.You may want to remind students that the questions may change from quiz to quiz. In many of these on-demand courses, the quiz questions do not change and students may be in the habit of not rereading the questions they have gotten correct on previous attempts.Week 2 – Revenue After Cash Collection at 7:39 – talking about Days Unearned Revenue and mentions that an “increase means slower future recognition”. A bit more explanation around what that means would be useful.Week 3 – no particular additional comments on the lectures other than some in-line questions might be good.. I found Benford’s Law really interesting.Week 4. It would be really nice to have something to break up the lectures – some in-line quiz questions might help. This would also help to reinforce the material.Week 4 quiz Question 9 -, the double negative wording of the question and the correct response may cause confusion for students – particularly for those for whom English is not their native language.Overall CommentsI enjoyed the course and learned a lot. I was wondering whether it would be possible to provide a summary document with all the key information from each week related to the ratio calculations and the key things to look for related to those ratios. I know that the ratios are provided in the spreadsheet but it might be good to have a written summary with some supplemental information about how to use the ratios.I think in-line quizzes or practice questions would be helpful for students – perhaps ones that asked students to do specific things in the spreadsheet and come back with an answer. They don’t need to be long or complicated – just something that gets people into the spreadsheets and working with them early. You may want to do something stronger to encourage them to “play” with the spreadsheet. Many will feel reluctant to change the numbers in the spreadsheet for fear of “messing” it up. Perhaps a reminder that they can change whatever they want because if they mess something up they can always download it again. Or they can save a copy and play in that leaving the original untouched.It also might be a good idea to have a “playground” sheet where there is a simple set of Financial Statements and the students can try changing things in the financial statements and see the impact on the key ratios without having to move from one spreadsheet to another – so, a combination of the Original tab and the first two columns of the Ratios tab. You might even want to have two columns for the ratios – one for the ratios with the original numbers that does not change (fixed values) and one for the changed numbers, so students can see the effect of the changes easily.In terms of the spreadsheets, I thought that the Original, the Ratios and the CommonSize tabs were fairly straight forward and relatively easy to understand. That may not be the case for people less familiar with MS-EXCEL but I don’t know what the target audience is for this course so the students may all be proficient with the tool. On the Valuation tab, I was wondering if the numbers in Row 41 should be highlighted in some way to emphasize that they are Years. That is not clear on first glance.There are a lot of mistakes in the subtitles. I pointed out many of these by flagging the specific videos where they occurred.Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the beta-test of this course. I hope that my comments are helpful and that I have not missed too much that causes students issues as the course goes live.",1.0,1,0,1,0,0.0,0,0,0

"The course and specialization looks promising but I get the feeling that the instructors have been a little lazy while designing the assignments. Instead of auto-grading using well known testing frameworks (like other Coursera courses), the entire grading policy is based on reviews from fellow students which makes your grade subjective, secondly, since the number of mandatory required reviews for each student is fixed at 5 (and is not adjusted with the number of students), it is highly unlikely that all submissions will be reviewed or graded.",0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"There were some interesting insights coinciding with my own experience of learning (I have learnt 8 languages by myself). Particularly the part about chunking was a really good one. On the other hand, Week 4 focusing on how to pass a test in my opinion jumbled the previous material up - passing a test doesnt mean knowledge, it means ability to pass a test. Half of the questions used in the final Quiz shows that this course itself has tried not to develop chunks they were recommending but to make students memorize the content of the video without checking whether or not the content was actually understood and chunked into real knowledge.So, a better name for this course would be Learning how to learn academically. As for me, I appreciate non-academical knowledge. Kids master their native language without getting the ability to teach it - and this is the true knowledge even though in the farewell video prof. Sejnowski equalized the ability to teach to the knowledge.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

This review is based on the last three courses that I have undertaken in the Data Structure and Algorithms Specialization.While running our tests the output does provide the time and memory used for running our algorithms.

It would provide us with an additional motivation to think about better and efficient implementations.Note: I do understand that running times might not always be an exact reflection of the actual time the algorithm takes.,1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"Overall I really enjoyed this course, and I think I learned a lot, so thank you!However I think there were some things that could be improved.Firstly the quality of the code provided for the programming assignment was very low. It contains a lot of things that are far from modern c++ best-practices (e.g. using raw arrays instead of std::vector, mixing malloc and new, using new where there is no reason to use it, using raw pointers when references would be fine, missing consts, macros, ...). There were also some relatively minor bugs: the first log message doesnt print with the correct prefix, and the grading script as provided doesnt run (IIRC it was because the #! isnt on the first line). Since this course could be some peoples first introduction to C++ I feel that its important to set a good example, and to keep the code simple and safe.Secondly the symbols used for things were often inconsistent between slides, which was occasionally confusing but should be easy to fix.Despite these issues I still think this is a great course, it just could be a little bit better.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

"I found this course in the suggestions list after taking Introduction to Music Production with Loudon Stearns. I audited it, so I couldnt/didnt do the assignments but I found it really interesting so I binge-watched the lectures in the space of a day. The way the course is set up as compared to Intro to Music Prod. it is a lot less detailed technical instruction and more of a broad look at the artistic/aesthetic/philosophical components of various aspects of music production. And since Loudon touches upon this in the other course, I would say the two courses nicely complement each other and are both worth watching all the way through. I think they could be taken in any order, but personally, even though Intro is more technical, I think I got more out of this one having already taken Intro. Even as someone who considers myself pretty good as far as lyrics/songwriting/composition, I still got something new and useful out of those parts and liked the way the instructor put these creative parameters in concrete terms. The way he talked about and clarified Vision, Identity, and Intention I personally found very empowering, interesting, and practically useful. I feel like some of these ideas had been floating around in my mind before, but it validated that they were valuable things to be thinking about. There are a couple specific things that popped up in the course that are really cool and useful: for example, the rule of threes, and the information on panning, delay, mixing, etc. Very glad I found it!

If this had been a free course I might have gone up to two stars, but I probably wouldnt have finished.This course attempts to take complex social awareness and patterns and reduce them to an understandable set of skills to be practiced... but it fails. I find it to be full of new-age dreamy ramblings that do not really help in the real world.Leadership is influence, which comes as a mixture of experience and intention. This course seems to discount experience in favour of sense, used in this context as a poorly-translated summing up of the physical senses and their analysis.This course requires you to create an intimate written self-portrait, which you then find yourself sharing with a stranger and comparing. The exercise is interesting, and a lot of students have bought into the premise that this is a genuine conversation and allows them to explore their ability to know another person. I am the heretic in the room: I think the student wish to appear intelligent to their peers and the emperor is in fact shamefully unclad. If this is what the world considers a genuine conversation then the world is a shallower place than I had thought.This course, unfortunately, over-promises and under-delivers, and I am not in the least tempted to take the next one in the series.

Im talking about students that think they are too busy, too slow, too old, not smart enough, etc. This is an at your own pace class, which I really appreciated for learning concepts in physics. The way this course accomplishes this amazing feat is by presenting everyday physical actions like dropped balls out of three story windows, or manned wheeled carts gliding across the floor, or bumper car physics explained with air hockey games, and then explaining the laws of physics that are behind the actions. Knowing the physics behind what we see everyday is so enriching, and my eyes are much wider now. This course, taught by Dr. Louis Bloomfield, is also amusing and entertaining, as Dr. Bloomfield races up and down the steps of the empty University of Virginia Physics building for the dropped ball gravity experiments, or crashes himself (standing on a wheeled cart) into the wall to illustrate energy and momentum transfer.

"This course is well worth a students time and effort. There are excellent presentations by the professor, but in its current format the course is too short for the amount of technical knowledge implicit in the material. In addition, the quizzes are poorly written. Some questions are asked at the end of modules when the subject of the question is not even introduced until the following module. Further, for some questions the right answer is either not given in the choices presented or the grading protocol doesnt recognize the correct answer. Some questions ask what answer is most correct which implies that there is a strong element of subjective judgement involved in its formulation. The student is allowed only one attempt at a quiz every 8 hours, where many other Coursera courses allow 3 attempts every 8 hours, which is more conducive learning and retaining the material due to the instant feedback. Finally, there are several NOT or opposite answer questions which are valid but confusing, so the student must be careful when answering.Recommendations: 1. Add at least three more sessions to the class and spread the technical material out over more sessions. 2. Rewrite the quiz question set to clarify what you are asking, and make certain the material was covered in the module you are assessing. 3. Dont use what is the best answer (most correct) type questions, they are ALL too subjective to be fair. 4.

"My overall experience with this Specialization, in general, and this 1st Course, in particular, is very positive.On the positive side, I really like the fact that the Courses are practice-oriented and provide not only theoretical frameworks, but also insights from experts, practical guidance, and evidence-based best practices.Also, the idea of applying Team-Based Learning (TBL), in the forms of Readiness Assurance Tests (RATs) and scenario-based RAT Application Exercises, for assessing participants learning, is excellent!However, there are a couple of downsides, thats why Im not giving a 5 star positive feedback.The first problem is that not all of the required readings are freely available via the Coursera platform, or elsewhere online. I appreciate the excellent quality of the chosen materials, but, if it becomes compulsory to spend more than US $100 for buying books, then the total cost of this Specialization elevates quite a lot, given that I had to pay €162 for it. On my opinion, there should be at least a note in the description of both the Specialization and the Courses about these requirements, in order to make an informed decision before enrolling.The second downside has to do with Course 1 and Course 2 overlapping materials. Im referring to guest interview videos. Thats mainly a problem of the 2nd Course, as there are almost no guest interviews in this Course, and the one interview provided is already available in Course 1. I understand that the topics discussed apply to the topics of both Courses, but, still, I find it an unnecessary repetition.The last problem is about the dates that the Courses are run. Course 1 runs during a given period, Course 2 is on demand, but it makes sense to attend it before Course 3, that also runs during a given period, which overlaps with the period of the 1st Course. Sorry, this makes it very difficult to attend everything and to seriously focus, as its always about running for deadlines, especially when one has to produce three (3) Board Effectiveness Assessment Reflection (BEAR) papers :( .",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

"The course itself and the content of it is great, the only suggestions would be:1) It could be reviewed, how the evaluations of each submission are made. For example, 1st assignment - descriptive analysis was asked to evaluate based on if the 3 most important things - if they have been mentioned in the description. The thing is that in real you can not tell, which are the most important because people think differently and could focus more on other details. It was easy to add also those important points by resubmitting work, but the problem is that only with that the analysis of a student is not getting better, thus the evaluation is not precise. For tasks like that I would suggest at lease to make a list of 20 things to mention and then count how many are there - thus making the quality assessment more precise.2) Some topics could have been explained more detailed in the videos, e.g., about guide tones and lines3) The requirements for the submissions could have been more clear. I also got the impression that in if switching the sessions the requirements could be slightly different (As I got the case when somebody pointed out a particular thing that he thought was required and I have not done.

Altogether I have to say the course was no waste of my time since I certainly did learn a lot but it could use some honing on a few sides.

"I found the course rather difficult, with respect to the other courses I did on Coursera. In my opinion part of the reason I found it difficult is that the material is not explained very well. Hinton is certainly a guru in Machine Learning, but I found him a bit boring as a teacher and often I thought he was explaining some details but failing to give the broader picture. I must admit I did not read the extra material provided with the course (the long articles) but only focused on the videos, slides and tests, perhaps had I read the articles I would have struggled less. I also did the course in 9 weeks instead of 16, but I did watch most videos twice so I feel I did dedicate some time to it. I much preferred Andrew Ngs course, and I strongly recommend doing that one first.

As a Java programmer with some 18 years industry experience I quickly got lost on this course. It might not be the course - it could be me! It might be that I am too long in the tooth as an OO programmer that I cannot cope with the transition to functional programming.I found the video lectures initially well structured and stepped nicely in to increasing complexity without losing me. But eventually I fell completely behind and by the time I was performing the exercise 2 submission I was in deep water. There are a lot of mathematical theory and programming theory references along the way as well which I did not like.As a real world programmer I have never really felt compelled to know peano number theory. And I struggle to understand how performing this exercise prepares me for real-world Scala programming either. I just do not see the point of creating code that can add and subtract numbers without using number types!!! I could write a wrapper for Int in Java in 2 minutes. Doing this abstract Scala exercise would take me all day and I still do not understand the code nor the point of doing it! Whatever happened to maintainability principles ?I have now lost all interest in completing the course because by week 3 I might as well be doing a course in advanced Arabic. I cannot continue this course now because I cannot complete the exercises. I am disheartened and not sure whether this is a reflection of Scala or the course or both. I would be reticent to take a job with Scala.,0.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"This was a fascinating course on how to revive a failing business area by use of government financing of primarily tech start-ups. It was a place in the country that is very different than Silicon Valley. The knowledge to finance a new startup was very limited and had to be set up in government funded groups that could mentor all the new businesses. There was a quick tour to other countries such as Greece which showed that even the EU had set up a Fund for Greek startups. The one they were working on was a company that was trying to produce an app. They did say that due to the lack of tech knowledge in their country the EU Fund was still full of money and could fund other startups. The main course went back to Cleveland, where most of the effort was made to use a government approach. They set up their own foundations, extended loans, made contacts with Venture Capitalists that participated in Silicon Valley and in this new type of gov approach. After 10 years of working with this, they had some very good companies with great ideas. The only drawback was that they didnt employ enough people to revitalize the entire area of Cleveland. They were just beginning to do something that used the actual resources of the area. There was a well known Cleveland Medical Center and some of the Professors there had done research which was new. For some reason, again the lack of business resources, they had never created any companies from what they knew. They did begin to create companies from the medical researchers in the area. The main one had to do with maintaining cardiac health. And",0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"This was a decent overview of FP principals, but a poor introduction to the Scala language. In fact, the requirements should just come out and state that you must have prior Scala knowledge to most thoroughly appreciate the course.

If you are stuck, you have no hope on these forums and will need to find help somewhere else.Programming assignments are great, they are relevant, interesting, challenging and the automatic grader system estimates not only if we get the correct answer but also the efficiency of our algorithm. There have been some problems in divide and conquer section though. Ive been struggling with implementing binary search (which is quite a simple algorithm!) in JavaScript to pass the assignment for weeks. Ive written and rewritten it in different ways, done hundreds of manual and automated tests, posted on course forums (receiving zero answers) and have gotten the same error again and again. I was able to solve this only by switching to Python. I am quite sure there is a mistake in the test case, which cost me hours and hours. Overall, the programming assignments are very time consuming and lack of support and not showing test cases make things worse.I do not like that we cannot see the test case where our program fails. Perhaps, if you could figure out a test case that might fail in your program that would make you a better programmer but I felt more like it was wasting of our time. The main thing is to analyze the test case that fails and understand why, it will bring the same result without wasting time and feeding anger,Some lecturers have a strong Russian accent, that is very distracting. It is not a lot of work to take some English pronunciation training before making a course, isnt it?Overall, I enrolled for the specialization and planned to buy it in full but bought only this course to start with. Now I am glad I did that because now I am not sure about buying the other courses and will look somewhere else first.Anyway, the creators of the course have done a great job, which is highly appreciated. I believe you can make this course much better by fixing the issues I pointed above.",1.0,0,1,0,0,1.0,0,0,0

"If possible I would rate a 4.5 out of 5 for this course. The lecturers are very good and comprehensive (compared to all other sources I found in the web) at explaining how cryptocurrencies (especially BTC) work and what the up- and downsides are. The workload for lecture videos is pretty low for each week (1-2h a week) which makes the learning targets pretty easy to achieve in the proposed time. I found the programming assignments quite difficult when beginning with each one, since one needs to read and understand (most) of several hundred lines of starter code and also needs to understand the task setting which uses a somewhat different terminology than used in the lectures. Also for assignment 1 and 3 there is no simple test code provided to at least partially test your code submission candidates. That makes it hard to debug in case of small logical errors that cannot be detected by the compiler but probably break the complete solution and result in a very low score. I had no experience in Java programming before the start of this course but with a one day crash course of Java for Python programmers I managed to complete all assignments in time (and learn at least the basic principles of Java, which is nice for itself). Each assignment is expected to take 3h by the creators of the course. The come up with a high score (not just passing) I needed to invest about 5-9 hours for each assignment which is probably but not exclusively due to the little knowledge of Java. Nevertheless I would encourage the creators of this course to use Python assignments for future courses since this would make prototyping a lot easier (due to its interactivity) and attract more students without having real downsides (at least to my knowledge).

"Unfortunetly I can only give a 3/5. There were more things that I didnt like and think that should be improved.What I liked: Positive to see Illinois keep presenting specializations on Coursera. The material was ok, with clean presentation style. The case studies is a very positive resource to have in the course to think critically.What I didnt like: The course is excessivelly short, with only 30-40 minutes of videos per module. Previous courses in both specialization - digital marketing and improving videos have at least 1.5 to 3 hours of video materials. A huge gap. Also if I benchmark against the top specializations from Wharton and U. Michigan (Business Foundations, Business Analytics, Leading People and Teams and Finance: Valuation and Investing) all of them pack a 1.5 to 3 hours of video lectures. There is a huge gap. Also I didnt found the quizzes challeging. In a digital world content is king - both in quality and quantity. You have quality, but are missing the quantity. Unfortunetly I see a trend - the other course of the managerial economics specialization also is very short. A minor thing that I also didnt like was the form that the slides were presented. As in previous specializations - in my opinion all of the module slides should be in the readings section in only one document, instead of divided in small pieces per video lecture.I hope that yu accept my critic as constructive because I have liked most of Illinois courses and was very impressed by the quality and extensive set of videos in the Improving Business speciaization.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1,0,1

"The course content was very interesting, however, the way it was presented was very dull and monotonous.

Specially when it comes to a course with so much geographical content, it would be good to have a more consistent depiction of maps. Furthermore, with all the new concepts, visual aid would help students understand what things are and what they look like since the backgrounds chosen for the lectures have little or nothing to do with the course whatsoever.On the other hand, I do think that the questions throughout the videos are extremely useful as they (usually) tackle problems that were not mentioned previously and gets the student to think independently.

"The course is a bit disorganized and could have been better. While the topics are really interesting and Geoffrey is really knowledgeable, a lot of simple concepts have been made seemly complicated from the way they have been presented -- often requiring external follow up studies (and often discovering in surprise how simple they actually are). such as, contrastive divergence (CD1) algorithm to train Restricted Bolazamann Machine (read wikipedia to get it in under 2 mins), functioning of sigmoid belief net etc. I believe, the issue arises from slides based teaching, where a slide of texts is presented and then there is a long monologue of how that system works from start to end. A more useful approach would have been to actually draw-and-talk (good example of such courses are Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, Game Theory (esp. Kevin Leyton-Brown parts).

"First of all, I really enjoyed Professor Ittners presentations. Sadly, his presentation was only 25% of the course. Professor Ittner was very direct but also was very engaging in how he delivered his content. I had a good feeling that I could really understand the material he was teaching. If I could give a rating for just Professor Ittner, I would give a 5 star rating. Now, this is why I am giving this course a 1 star rating. But I do have to say, going into the depths of Accounting Analytics is not easy. You really need to have a good grasp of Accounting otherwise you will get lost. Professor Bushee did not make the first 3 weeks really easy to get through. While I enjoyed his examples & case studies, he simply did not do a great job of really explaining and illustrating the concepts he was teaching. And worst of all, he setup a digitally generated classroom where he had his computer generated students ask pointless questions, make pointless statements, or answer with pointless statements/answers. I really wish I had the time to analyze how much of the course time he spent doing this, I would estimate that its around 10% but it could very well be higher. There are so many different examples to pick form, but Ill just pick a few here. I didnt read the Iliad or Odyssey some Im not going to ask you to in reference why in regression there are Greek letter used for coefficients (its a fair assumption that someone taking this class understands coefficients), a 30 second exchange where a PC generate student says that theyre stocked to run some regression followed by Proffessor Bushee informing us that were going to run some narly regressions, Professor Bushee saying he doesnt know how to perform Earning Management Analysis on Mars but he certainly knows how to do it on Earth, and a joke why people dont like accountants.

An assignments truly buck up the material. And I think material give a grounding in future Android Development.But I think it can be problem with the learning process, mostly with programming assignment. I think its common that when course come out for the first time its almost inevitably that there are some issues with autograder. It s just common. But these issue are usually easy to spot, because the output of autograder contains test cases. So one can easily find out what the problem is, if its with autograder. As for this course, the autograder output is very minimalistic, and if the problem is with autograder its rather hard to spot. I myself spent entire evening, trying to find what is wrong with my code, and it was pure luck that I finely spotted the problem (and, yes, it was autograder issue). Such thing could be very frustrating, really.Another problem with programming assignments is about Peer Review. The students actually get access to assessment criteria, after they have submitted they code. And their code not necessary fit these criteria.

That way you can go deeper in to the SQL explanation, and can get at thee same time a better understanding of each topic, instead of getting a lot of thing to cope in just one week.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1,0,1

"Overall I enjoyed this course and got a broad overview of the various technologies used in big data analysis. The course is video heavy but short on practice. There are 3 assignments the first 3 weeks, then week4 is an endless series of videos. I really enjoyed the assignments but felt there should have been more assessment/practice provided -there are no quizzes to reinforce understanding. The readings provided are mostly academic ones which arent that clear to beginners (even to programmers like me).In contrast, a Python data science course on another MOOC platform has 4 times as much content with practice exercises after every video, mid and final exams, weekly problem sets as well as readings.Ultimately the course showed me what I need to learn next to get into Data Science but the first course hasnt given me confidence that the rest of the specialization will be worth the money.",1.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,1,1,1

"this was my least favorite of the classes - the lectures ere not informative, and far too lofty. The style class, the plot class and the setting class all had detailed, concrete teachings, whereas these lectures were too airy. Most of them consisted of authors chatting with each other. The assignments required real craft however, and it would have been helpful to LEARN those skills in the modules.For example, one assignment asked us to describe a character in a setting, while they were not actually there - say a divorced nurse in a hospital. Not once in the lectures were we ever taught HOW to do this. We watched a series of author fireside chats, and then people bumbled through the assignment. I really wanted Amy Bloom to just walk over to the board and draw a character and say this is a woman, shes divorced, shes middle class, she tends to get very angry when things dont go her way or whatever,and then draw out a list of how her internal states might manifest in the world around her - she throws things, shes disorganized, she writes mean notes in the patient charts.I wanted her to teach. She seems to think we already know how to do things like imply a characters state of mind through action. I mean, for a beginning writer, its helpful to just make a list of details about a character - where theyre from, what they like or dont like, what sort of flaws they might have and so on.

"Excellent class! This is an overview of who Jefferson was, what he really thought and believed in, what his contradictions were and why they existed, and how the perception of him has changed through different historical periods. I thought I knew a reasonable amount of information about Jefferson and the revolutionary period, but I learned so much about the historical and cultural context of the time and how it shaped Jeffersons thoughts!Given our current judicial systems split over whether the constitution should be regarded according to the originalist intention or whether it is a living document, I was surprised to find that Jefferson himself saw it as a living document, to be reshaped by each generation. Understanding why he thought that is really essential to understanding how to think about the problem today. So this isnt just history, its current events!I was concerned that the course seemed to be all lecture, but by the second week I was hooked. Dr Onuf is a compelling speaker, and tries to convey who Jefferson was, the world he existed in, and get you to think about Jefferson in all his complexity.

IMO way too much time and energy is wasted on history, name-dropping and dry mathematical backrounds. Andrew Ng of Stanford University, with his course Machine Learning is a great example of how it can and should be done.Suffice to say it would be much more smoth, fun and efficient to start with 1) current real world relevant problem(s) motivating the technique, then 2) a clear description of the technique - with concrete examples mapping the theory to practice.

But then Id have to flip back a few lectures in the morning for a close-listening because I didnt want to miss a single nugget of information.Prof. Covach does what a lot of books and courses on the Beatles fail to do. He looks straight at the music and brings in biography and history where necessary. But its the music that provides the beat to this course. Prof. Covach digs deep into songs to provide insight on song form/shape, lyrics, theme, etc. and then ties those observations together with songs that come later in the course. So you get a sense of the Beatles growth as songwriters. What were they influenced by? What did they repeat? How did they alter that repeated form? What conventions did they fall back on when they needed to write a hit single.Though the course does delve into some music theory, its accessible to the layperson, eg, talking about a flatted seventh used in a John song.

"Not being an historian on the Middle Ages, Magic in the Middle Ages seems like an accurate and well planned course. Week-4 and week-5 were the most interesting, with week-5 delving into the knitted relationship of magic in Islam, with roots and lineages directly connected to contemporary practices of magic (which is something I did not know and was very curious about regarding the context of political and religious tensions evolving throughout the middle east). I would have liked more activity-based and practical instructional units on how magic and rituals were conducted, especially information on healing, medicines, and alchemy. Geomancy was the only practical component with explicit details on how to cast figures, and it needed to incorporate how it was used with astrology in a practical way. A unit on Astrology and the Astrolabe was needed as well since the videos and literature often referred to astrology, and without a basic working and understanding of how an astrolabe was used to calculate a chart, the student is left hanging on having to figure way too much on their own (which becomes rife with problems and miscommunication). The quizzes and assignments are fun but often awkwardly worded which became confusing, and can easily be cheated on. Grading of assignments was a bit nebulous and put into question others abilities to accurately and fairly grade. People paying money for course content should be separated from students not paying because engaging, stimulating, and critical analysis as discourse cannot be maintained in fidelity. Of course, the credibility of ALL courses on Coursera are at stake because little to no universities and businesses accept the certificates as valid credentials for jobs or career ladder mobility. Ultimately, one is paying for a piece of paper that is not really valued or even usable at the very same institutes that put together the coursework; and that is a very lame proposition!

This per se is definitely not bad (it rather resembles real life), but all the other courses I have taken on Coursera and other platforms provide enough material and/or explanations to be able to work out all the problems without needing to look it up somewhere else.The problem-solving issue also has to do, to a certain extent, with the formulation both of some questions and answers, which in some cases can be understood in different ways because a key word is missing or is wrong, usually prepositions. I am aware of the fact that the course creators are not native English speakers, but, when formulating questions and answers, they should take the time to check their formulations for grammar and correctness (I am sure there would be no mistakes if the course were in French :) ).I posted a couple of questions on the forums and, sadly, never received an answer. Neither from fellow students, nor from the course moderators. Certainly the fellow students do not have any obligation to reply to questions, and I usually would say the course moderators dont either. But I am paying for this certificate and I therefore expect some kind of support. I am sure the course moderators are very busy and do not have time to be browsing around the question forums every day, but so am I. And taking a look in the forums once a week or so wouldnt hurt. Let me also point out, that the 2 questions I posted are THE ONLY questions in the forums, so its not as if the moderators would be overwhelmed by the amount of questions posted. After my second question, I knew I was all by myself. From other courses I know that course moderators chime in once in a while on questions that have not been answered by fellow students and when no fellow student seems to be able to find or provide a correct answer.The course is good, and you will learn a lot. If it werent for the lack of support in the forums, I would give it 4 or maybe even 5 stars, depending on the responses I would receive.Either way, enjoy the course!! I really did, even if it may not sound like it :)",1.0,1,1,0,1,1.0,0,0,0

"Hi,I got promoted as a beta tester only 4 days ago, which was too short to review the whole course. So, heres my review for the first two weeks.The course is nice and easy to follow. It looks like beginner level. However, since it seems aimed at beginners, I think the teacher should put more emphasis on- good practices (i.e. when there are several ways to do something, always indicate which one is recommended).- accessibility for people with disabilities, which should be a priority when creating new websiteAlso, I think that 3 weeks is a bit too short. The first week should at least be split in two so that students get more time to practice HTML/CSS coding.Lastly, there should be many more practice quizzes and (why not?) optional projects.Thank you for having me as a beta tester.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"I recommend the course, for anyone who understands some math and science.

Especially about the analysis of radiation as it interacts with the atmosphere, I think I went too fast, and relied on looking at a graph to get myself through the lesson.

Followed by four possible answers: One of which is clearly incorrect while one makes an awful assumption. These two choices can be eliminated easily.

"The instructors a fantastic comedic duo! I had numerous laugh out loud moments while getting a much better handle on machine learning. The instruction is clear and the homeworks are always interesting and well thought out.I really only have one complaint: Graphlab. Graphlab is a fantastic piece of software that makes data science easy. I was amazed at how much harder it was for me to complete the home works with scikit and pandas. Unfortunately, its very unlikely that any future employer will be using Graphlab. Its a great intro for noobs (like me), but its very expensive and can be replicated with open source packages. As such, I had to spend a lot of time trying to figure out on my own how to perform graph lab operations in the open source world. Avoiding this kind of slow, frustrating, stack exchange binging, 50 tab opening, nonsense is one of reasons I take MOOCs in the first place. I hope a future version sets up the bones of what open source packages can be used to solve each problem set.In summary, I really enjoyed this class. I was excited to work on it. I learned things that made me more productive at work. I felt the joy of learning.

"I have found this a deeply frustrating experience. The main lecturer, Professor Adam Gearey, clearly knows his subject well but is a terrible communicator. His lectures are poorly constructed, repetitious and sometimes confusing. He seems at times to be delivering the lecture as a stream of consciousness rather than a properly prepared lecture: as a result he sometimes misspeaks himself, for example saying that murder trials are conducted in the High Court rather than the Crown Court, and these errors have not been picked up and corrected. I am forced to wonder whether anybody in the University of London team bothered to quality check these videos. These problems are compounded by the uncorrected subtitles and transcripts of the lectures, obviously done by somebody with no understanding of the subject. It is also frustrating that when I raised these concerns in the weekly discussion forum, I received replies from a volunteer moderator which were so badly written as to be almost unintelligible. This moderator made no attempt to enter into constructive discussion, but told me that you cannot say our professor is wrong because you disagree with him and that I should read the sentence properly: in other words, no criticism, however constructive, can be tolerated. Even some of the questions in the quizzes are carelessly constructed: for example, the correct answer to q8 in the final quiz uses the word allowed (which implies an element of discretion) instead of required, which would have properly reflected the provision in question (s.6 HRA 1998 - the authority could not have acted differently ). All in all, the presentation of this course falls far short of the academic standards I expected from a university with Londons reputation.",1.0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0,0,1

"There are two frustrations with this iteration of the series. One: the quiz questions are often opaquely worded. Instead of being tested on the material just learned, it seemed like the objective was to learn to decode test questions.2 and the most glaring omission, was that when students are asked to provide functions, only some are provided with a follow up test to ensure the function is working properly. If the output is syntactically correct but provides incorrect output then youre moving forward blindly after that. Then add the quiz questions from problem One above, and youre just wasting your time after that and building up frustration. Validating your code as you move along seems like a pretty rudimentary process to impart to students and when the teachers dont practice it themselves, there are bound to be problems.I like the intent of the course, and considering my outsider background to computer science, the mathematics etc, I did learn a fair bit.

I have loved feeling that I am really a live student of this MOOC and not just looking at/reading some pre-recorded lectures from which the course leader is much removed. It has been great to get regular updates from Al and feel he really cares. I had a wee grump initially when I realised just how North American the poetry presented was going to be but this was a very short-lived grump when I realised the wealth of material and how much insight it could shed on other art. I did wonder why so many people seemed to redo this MOOC but now realise that doing the symposium session is just the tip of the iceberg. I actually had withdrawal symptoms when I realised I had finished but promised myself a short semester break before moving on and through more of the material. I had never studied poetry before and felt quite anxious about writing essays about poetry and about contributing to forums but found that I really enjoyed both, particularly writing and reviewing essays. This process was helped so much by the course videos where poems were close read and I could see that personal opinion mattered. I participated in the forums but did not create enough time to do them justice and look forward to deeper connections.

Also the weekly content should be more extended. In most parts of the course there are a lot of technical concepts, and the course lacks any type of resources.

I think what should have been tested was the end product by the autograder rather than the exact code. Im not sure how that would work but it would result in a more precise grade rather than the 87.5% everyone gets and also help the student write his/her own code rather than proofreading and selecting others. I did thoroughly enjoy the course and am looking forward to Course two of the series on CSS3.,1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,1,1

"This contains some very interesting and challenging exercises related to Global Warming I, which are fun to work on. It contains no real instructions about python, and I think it would be better to at least have some guidance there. However, the course info is at least totally up-front with that information.Although this course is related to Global Warming II, it is not correlated with it. It would be a mistake to take them concurrently, since GW-II moves much faster, and is a much shorter course. This was not clear to me when I signed up, and it should be made clear to students at the beginning.I like Prof. Archer a lot, he seems like a good teacher. However, aside from brief introductory lectures (and the selection of great topics for simulation) he plays a rather small role in the course. The student is pretty much on his own. There is no TA or anyone monitoring Discussion questions. There are some places where the Model Description notes are incorrect and badly misleading (notably in Week 4).

The work load is higher than the guidelines suggest for someone who hasnt done any programming for a while and is not familiar with object-oriented programmingYaakov is very knowledgeable and presents the material in an accessible way. He throws in some humor, which helps with absorbing the material. The quizzes are good learning guides and are appropriate for the material in the course. They require some thought, but adhere to the topics in the course without assuming additional knowledge. The exercises are difficult and take more time than the listings. But the reference materials are helpful and the online forums are very useful in clarifying points of uncertainty. I found some of the assignment descriptions, especially in modules four and five, to be unclear and it took some additional research to understand the intent of the task.The registration process and installation of the needed software was clearly explained and easy to accomplish. The software worked well with the course and enhanced the learning experience. I especially liked the way BrowserSync worked with Sublime Text and Chrome. The Chrome analysis tools are very useful.

"I am really disappointed with the content of this course. If what youre looking for is the most basic of information on making better choices and remembering to wash your cutting board after handling raw meat, maybe this course is for you. If, however, you come to this course wanting specific information about how to build great meals for babies, toddlers, and young children, or youd like to know how their needs change over time, this course is not for you. I was hoping for information like how to teach your toddler to chew/eat difficult things (ex: whole apples). I wanted to know at what age/weight you switch to 2% milk. I wanted to know how many calories a meal should be based on height and weight and how that changes over time. I wanted to know medically verified tips on getting the right amount of each nutrient into a toddlers diet and what, if any, extra vitamins should be added. I wanted tips on weaning if youre still nursing a toddler... I guess I just wanted more.In addition, the quizzes are so easy as to be silly. Actual quiz question and correct answer: Which is NOT a good way to approach grocery shopping if healthy choices are desired? Answer: Visit the supermarket hungry and walk through the candy aisle first. COME ON! Did I need a Stanford University course to tell me that one?!?!?While the instructor is knowledgeable, this course is geared toward someone with NO knowledge, not someone who wants to gain a deeper understanding. The videos are painfully slow (am I waiting for a doodle here???) and I could read the entire course worth of transcripts in under a half hour rather than go through all of the videos. And the recipes... good god! I dont think that someone interested in learning more about child nutrition is needing a slow tutorial on how to make basic oatmeal on the stove top. If shed upped the game- showed basics and then talked about the benefits of adding, say, chia seeds, different fruits, flax, etc. and how best to make a basic bowl of oatmeal into a complete breakfast, that would have been a useful topic.Im just hugely disappointed.

In particular, the differences between the 20th and 21st of the month can be somewhat challenging for a beginning speaker of Korean. On the quizzes, I slowed down and repeated some of the audio.

Going backwards, I think. I also think ideally you would want to encourage people to write bigger chunks of code rather than get bogged down with word counting.However, the main issue is that the assignments are really badly put together. Its actually hard to understand what the underlying requirements are at first read - from about Week 3 onwards. The concepts are easy to understand, its the way they are worded and jumbled. I had to read them over and over again because there is a fair amount of jumping around and since there is filtering of the data, the order you carry out the tasks matter very much.I was looking forward to this course and planned to take 3 but now I regret paying for this one and thinking about finding another one.

"This was essentially a self-study project with some social peers. The topic, approach, and standards were different from all of the other units in the Data Science specialization.

If NLP is a prerequisite for this capstone project - whether in the form of a prior class or textbook knowledge - this should be indicated clearly on the course description page.Nevertheless, the main learning that I achieved with this course was in the area of software engineering - specifically, how to take advantage of vectorization in R to achieve reasonable computing performance. While this is a valuable skill, it doesnt seem the proper focus of a capstone course in a sequence focused primarily on other topics.As noted elsewhere in these comments, there was a complete absence of any traditional teaching support. Learning outcomes suffered as result. The missing resources included instructors, mentors, partners, and learning materials.The course site notes an expected time requirement of a few hours per week. My commitment was 20 hours per week, under some pressure. Numerous students take this course multiple time, in order to arrange for reasonable software development time.Producing working software was fun, as it always is.

"I must say that the Capstone Project was a good assignment. The issue is that the Peer Reviews were bad. I had to resubmit my assignment due to a student that choose to give me 0s when the other reviewers gave me 5s. There was also a bias to what each reviewer thought the capstone should cover so you had no idea which direction to update your work because the next reviewer may feel that the type of analysis you did was not Necessary.The course needs a specific Rubric and specific methods each person has to use in order to complete the assignment. For example, Must Use the Four Forces Model when evaluating Strategy. This way everyone knows what to expect and what to look for. Otherwise you can get a low grade on a great project because a Classmate thought you should have used another model so he gave you a 1 or 0 when the model you used demonstrated your knowledge.Capstones need to be monitored either by a student or assistant to protect against trolls that dont read your work and give you the lowest score.

Sure, there were some things which might be a little exclusively for language teaching, but Id say, more, really, the things they explained were about teaching and learning in general. Anyway, I can get that grammar stuff out of books , on the net, or even on the Youtube. Its what makes me a good or a better or a worse or a useless teacher I want to learn.

"I found the first 4 weeks of the course amazing: just really well structured, thought-out, and delivered in a way that positions the student for success. Jana breaks the material down into digestible bits, gives you sufficient practice, and even if you dont get it, you can look at the answers to the practice questions and figure out where your thinking was incorrect.The 5th week wasnt as well broken down, especially the last set of Teradata exercises. New concepts or ways of structuring queries were being introduced in those exercises, but there was no way to check for a correct solution if I couldnt come with one on my own (which was unfortunately half of the time). I still got a good grade on my last quiz, but I cant say that I really truly learned how to write the more complicated queries.I would suggest that the last Teradata exercise set has more explanation or perhaps just answers that the student can refer to in order to understand why his/her line of thinking isnt working.Otherwise, a truly fantastic course.

I shouldnt have to engage a very busy professional to intercede on the students behalf. Despite the large population of people taking the class (or is that cumulative?

This confused lots of us and those of us whod never used the transloadit.com script for uploading our assignments for peer-review would only know of transmission error if classmates flagged our submissions.

"This is just an addendum to my previous review. To make every bodies life easier, I would suggest imposing a requirement that all homework be done using Eclipse. It is a popular IDE for Java programming and certainly adequate for this course. Then, I would have the homework cast as an Eclipse Java Project for each assignment. In each raw assignment, include something like theDropBoxTest code that gives a testing framework. Personally, I would do that with a JUNIT style framework. Again, it just makes life easier. You could even bare bones testing assertions and have the students add their own stuff in which is what I eventually wound up doing. The test, themselves show how you expect the whole thing should work.Then, we students would import the homework as a new project, do what needs to be done and just submit the code developed. The point of including the testing framework is that ambiguities or interpretational variations can much reduced in what we are being asked to do. I found that all my problems pretty much came down to thinking about how I would implement the functionality of the specification quite differently then how it needed to be done to fit into the grading framework. There is really a lot of hidden specification in the grading framework. I could not have done the assignments without the DropBox... framework. The grading process gave very little hints about what might have gone wrong, which is ok for grading, but not so useful for debugging the problem. I think this kind of project approach would reduce a fair amount of the forum questions, and, at the same time, make this course more accessible for Java nubies.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

I spent tons of time researching, looking at the forums, and programming documentation. Going into this course, I was surprised about how much I knew when it came to the quizzes and how my time looking at all the resources above decreased and I actually knew where to begin! The course project was still VERY difficult for this beginning specialization compared to what information is given in the lectures (spent over 16 hours on it and still didnt meet ALL criteria). However, it does challenge you to think and reflect on your knowledge. You probably wont understand 100% of what is in the course (especially the project) but you will LEARN especially if you are totally NEW to programming like me!

"I probably have to rate this course 5 stars just for the supplementary reading materials provided. Theres a lot of great information provided here. This course helps formalize a process that highly talented people just do intuitively. With the information within, youre able to better understand different aspects of your creative process. At times, the professors delivery can be a little distracting (he has quite a few awkward pauses in the middle of thoughts, and uses the phrase, right? a little too unconsciously). I also found some of the lecture material difficult to connect in a practical sense. Some aspects of the design, play, experience model could use better examples in lecture to make the points more concrete. It is a deep model, and they do in fact point you to a whitepaper published on it so there is that, but just for the sake of the lessons; the examples need better explanation. The quizzes were easy, but challenging in the wrong way. Often, questions are posed that werent ever directly answered in lecture or the materials, and sometimes they are worded in ways that make it difficult to pinpoint what they are looking for. It would be nice to see student responses to the free-response questions make a comeback in future lessons or at least know that they could possibly carry into the material used to teach the next incoming class. The assignments follow a logical progression, and again are supplemented with great materials. The review system is a little wonky. Ive posted in the boards about this.

"The Good: This course is a good introduction to fundamental topics and basic techniques in machine learning. I feel that the biggest strength of this course comes from Prof. Ngs suggestions for how to design and improve machine learning systems in practice.The Bad: This course is a few years old, and there are a lot of errors in the videos and even occasionally in the programming exercises as well. In my opinion, there is a little too much hand-holding in the programming exercises, so that while I was able to implement the important bits and pieces of the algorithms, I didnt get much chance to practice the more difficult task of organizing the entire system.The Ambiguous: This course is *very* light on the math, perhaps as light as you could possibly get. I imagine this is a relief for a lot of people, but personally I felt annoyed and even a little patronized with the number of times Prof. Ng said that we dont have to worry about the mathematical details of different concepts and algorithms. Its fine to skip over derivations and details for the sake of a simple presentation or to emphasize practical application, but surely it is important to go back and see what all this stuff means eventually. I will certainly be looking for other courses on machine learning that give a more mathematical treatment, and I think that anyone who wants to seriously get into ML should probably do the same. On a related note, Prof. Ng takes his time in each video, speaking slowly, repeating different points, and carefully explicating formulas with examples. For some people that may be good, but I found myself frequently skipping ahead in videos because I just wanted to get to the point.",1.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

"The course is essentially a self-help guide focusing on the idea that cooking real food promotes health. This is certainly a message that many people need to hear.Unfortunately, the advice concerning what to eat is less sound. Let me illustrate this with a historical counterexample.Around 75 years ago, a Canadian dentist visited my home country of Switzerland, where he examined the health and diet of a population in a secluded mountain valley. He found them to be of exceptional health. Their diet?breakfast: rye sourdough bread, butter and cheeselunch: rye sourdough bread, butter and cheesedinner: rye sourdough bread, butter, cheese and potatoes, along with some vegetables in the warmer half of the year, and small amounts of meat on SundaysContrary to four fundamental recommendations in the course, these people ate a lot of saturated fat (butter) and animal protein (cheese), but few vegetables and had hardly any variation in their diet.They did prepare their own food, grown or pastured locally, in very mineral-rich soil, which imparted their butter and cheese with very high amounts of fat-soluble vitamins A, D and K2. Perhaps animal foods are not as unhealthy as the course suggests, and food (and soil) quality is paramount.Instead of taking this course, watch Maya Adams TEDx talk (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-gyIkA-crM) and browse the recommendations of the Weston A. Price Foundation (http://www.westonaprice.org/) to learn what to cook, in particular their Healthy4Life dietary guidelines (http://www.westonaprice.org/wp-content/uploads/Healthy4LifeEnglish.pdf).

"Fantastic!! Really enjoyed the courseInformative and enjoyable course which helped me understand the history of Rock/Popular music upto 1970. Prof Kovachs lectures helped me explore music and artists who I had long forgotten or did not even know of. This is a good course for both professionals like Djs, students as well as lay people like me who love both music as well as history.The only problem I had is that one had to do a lot of hunting on the net and that took a lot of my time. But it was well worth it because of what I heard and saw.The quizzes were sometimes too detailed and memory oriented. Maybe a more conceptual framework of questions can be considered in the future.Will definitely do Part 2 shortly!Thanks Prof Kovach and the Team.

There is added value through interesting stories. He chose great examples. He uses simple and easy to understand English. And he connects with the students even if the videos has been recorded. Awesome experience. I think I remember more of the concepts here than way back in college. As a test on this, I was writing in my notepad about all the concepts without looking at my digital notes. I did great!More on the course. I think he covered all the basics. He just didnt discuss more on Brand Architecture, Brand Audit, Brand Tracking, specifics on how to calculate Demand and Supply, etc. Plus, I think there could be a better way to present the product mix width, product line length and depth, stretching, and filling concepts (just that part).

For example, a possible assignment could be the implemention of a counter on a Web page using JavaScript or the creation of a web page with buttons, emerging messages, menus etc. On the web (Googling), there are a lot of codes that allow these funcionalities and could be used and modified by other students to create their own Web page.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"Before starting this course, I had no previous knowledge of machine learning and I had never programmed in Octave and I have little/no programming skills. This is a 11-week course and so I was not sure if I would make it to the end (or even get through the first week) but I was keen to learn something new.Positive Aspects: The course is extremely well structured, with short videos (and test questions to help us verify if we have understood the concepts), quizzes and assignments. Prof. Andrew Ng presents the concepts (some very difficult) in a clear and almost intuitive manner without going too much into detail with mathematical proofs, making the course accessible to anyone. The mentors were fantastic and provided prompt responses, links to tutorials and test cases, which all helped me get through the course.Negative Aspects: Searching the Discussion Board for something specific was no easy task. I would have liked to have known the answers to some of the questions in the quizzes that I got wrong.What I loved about this course: Learning how powerful vectorization is, it allows us to write several lines of code in one single line and can be much faster than using for-loops. I was wowed several times.Prof. Andrew Ng is a great teacher. He is also extremely humble and very encouraging. During the course he often said, Its ok if you dont understand this completely now. It also took me time to figure this out. This helped me a lot. He also said, if you got through the assignments, you should consider yourself an expert! and I laughed silly. By no means do I feel like an expert but now I have a basic understanding of the different types of learning algorithms, what they could be used for and more importantly this course has generated a spark in me to use this tool for things that I find interesting and for that I am very grateful.

For example, I spent a lot of time on the Bubble detection problem constructing graphs that allowed for multiple edges between two nodes, when it turned out that in order to pass I did not need to implement this.That being said, Ive learned a lot from the courses in this specialization, and thanks for the work put into it!",1.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,1
"I enjoyed this course, its balanced, easy enough for a general software programmer to start off into this math world. One thing I would wish for is a lesson exclusively talking about all the available options for any production needs, and talking about the different jargon that is used out there in the ML world and how we can relate it back to the jargon used in this course.For example, when I try to use R, I get to know that I need not code to start with and I can use off-the-shelf packages like caret to quickly try different models and compare their performance. But the real trouble I felt is when I tried to analyse their results, as I see too many new words and representations that are used, like Kappa, Specificity, etc.,.

"Pretty good in overall, but there are a few points that could be improved:- The content is taught in a weird order and the difficulty doesnt increase steadily. For example, week 4 and 5 feel like they have been made separately and about the same subject, but week 5 goes further. The last video of week 5 is interesting, but it seems improvised...- There could be more examples, especially from modern music. John from week 5 uses examples from the Beatles, which is great, but hes the only one. Week 3 has pretty much no examples at all.- Suppplementary material and notes are uneven from week to week. Week 2, 4 and especially 5 have good summaries of the videos and examples, but week 3 almost only has links to wikipedia...- The final exam is VERY difficult.

"Organization of the class is clear and easy to follow. However, it might be better to place the Supplementary Readings after the Essential Readings for each unit. At times I would miss these required readings on the outline. Other times I would think they were required readings for the upcoming unit, when in actuality they were still part of the required readings for the previous unit. Most of the time, I come across the supplementary readings after the quiz has been taken. And when youre following the steps on the website the computer screen determines where you go once each step is completed. The quizzes at the end of each unit should be placed at the end of each unit. I appreciate the ability to take quizzes at least three times and that you use the same quiz for each time it is retaken. Something I would change about the quizzes is, that the quizzes display the questions that were asked, instead of just marking with a green check mark or red X next to the number and the question that was asked, once the quiz has been submitted. The videos and transcripts of those videos is very helpful. The videos are very clear and easy to understand. The content of the supplementary readings at times went over my head, but the content is both helpful and useful information.The due dates for each assignment was reasonable and flexible. Aside from including the questions asked for each quiz after submission I would change your policy of establishing the honor code. When attempting to have my picture taken along with my ID to establish identification my head didnt quite line up with the Head Frame displayed on my screen and the button needed to be pressed in order to take the picture. The button was either not visible or the head shot frame was too high up.I understand the need to establish ones identity during online classes, but wouldnt it be better to create a electronic pledge for the students to agree to? One that would uphold and honor the Coursera Honor Code; When someone is asked to type the same sentence repeatedly theyre typing speed can increase because of the familiarity of that sentence.

There are many courses out there which do, but this course to great for learning a practical approach to problem solving with machine learning and data processing.If there is a downside, I would say that the use of paid packages in the lectures (graphlab) limits the students ability to learn Python using the freely available packages on the web, which was my personal preference.

I watched that one video many times over, but still ended up going to YouTube for actual training on the ins and outs. I know time is constrained in MOOCs and you dont get the full load of knowledge you would in a traditional school. However, my thoughts are that either give us an exercise so we can at least have that as experience in using it, or just remove it completely. The lecture was put together as a sort of Follow Along, but it really felt rushed and more of an Obligatory thing than an actual lesson.2) Give us more detail on the difference between Services and Factories.

"The Machine Learning course taught by Professor Ng is a good way to survey a variety of the commonly used techniques in the field. Though I had been exposed to algorithms like k-means, SVM, PCA, and regression before, it was good to see a unified treatment of all the subjects.The video lectures are good. In the early weeks I felt a bit overwhelmed by new information, but by the end of the session I was feeling that the lectures were being stretched out. In particular, I started noticing the professor would repeat every point 2 or 3 times. That may be a good style in general, but I found it time-wasting.The quizzes were good, but a few of the questions here and there were phrased poorly, in an ambiguous manner that made it hard to understand what exactly was being asked. One questioned used vocabulary we hadnt been introduced to. (Sorry, I dont remember in which unit this happened - it wasnt a big deal at the time.)I enjoyed the programming assignments the most and, quite frankly, lost interest at the end when there were no more to be done. Most of them were challenging - at least if you avoided using the tutorials which really take you through every step. I found the SVM programming assignment thin - we really didnt do anything there except multiply a couple matrices.I have mixed feelings about the transcripts that accompany the videos. On the one hand, they are very helpful for skipping ahead when one sees a certain idea repeated 3 or 4 times. On the other hand, they are obviously automatically generated and riddled with errors.

Im too young to have as visceral a reaction to the stories as my parents do, and partly I wanted to understand that generation of Americans and the effect that these events had on them better. Also, the Kennedy years were such an interesting historical moment, a time of great change and great potential (for both good and awful things). It was very interesting to listen to the professor trace the historical effects of many of the events of those days, and to see him measure the impact on later presidencies and world events. It was a brief class, and even the book couldnt go into enough detail for many of these topics, but I thought this was a good overview, and it merely sharpened my interest to learn more from other sources with other perspectives or areas of focus in the future.

"This course is a lite and approachable collection of tips on how to work with your brain to learn more effectively. It wont blow your mind with advanced techniques you havent heard before, but it is a nice succinct overview of what works better and what doesnt work so well. I picked up a few tips and had to sheepishly admit that I was guilty in the past of studying in a less than ideal way (I have a Bachelors degree). I would say this is a particularly useful course for young adults to take as its not too heavy and is useful in explaining to them how to be more effective and why the techniques in the course work. That is not to say of course, that it is not useful for all ages.I found Barbara to be reasonably effective as a presenter. She speaks a little slowly for my taste, but I sped up the playback speed to 1.25 and that made it comfortable. Her lectures are well thought out and smoothly delivered.I found Terry Sejnowski contributed little to the course however. His explanations were fumbling, muddled and confusing. I found myself reading Wikipedia more often then not to get a better explanation on the concepts he was supposed to be teaching. He just didnt explain them well. He also didnt really explain why he was explaining them at all. The lecture on neurotransmitters was particularly bad. In what way did any of that help me learn how to learn? I think most of his lectures are just not that necessary to the course. I also think Barbara could have done a better job herself. But I understand her wanted to include him as he is an apparent authority in the area and it lends some credibility to her course.I think its well worth taking and again I think this would be ideal for school kids (secondary) to help instill good practices early and steer them around a couple of easy to make mistakes.",1.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

I found the case studies (where you had to imagine a real life situation and select a decision) useful - there was one of these per week when I think there could have been more, perhaps three a week. The course would also have been improved by the use of peer assessment on the assignments. This would have made them feel more worthwhile and that someone else was actually reading them.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1
"Thank you very much for teaching me all the statistics courses in the specialization. Although it is an online study, I think I benefit a lot from the course contents, quizzes and problem sets and the training from final projects one by one. Also, I appreciate a lot the feedback from other students in the courses, which gives me more confidence on my study. As a matter of fact, I know I still have a lot of room to improve on my final project, such as consistency of EDA with the later part of my project, assessment on residual plots, real understanding on the trade off between model interpretation and prediction accuracy, etc., which I will improve in my future study and analysis. No matter where and what I will study in the future, I always bring the statistics knowledge and R skills that I learned from my first specialization from professors at Duke University.

"This course is very helpful and practical. Especially the opinion that we should focus on the process rather than the product makes great and obvious change to me.

"The content of the course so far is interesting - and to be fair, Ive only completed the first week of this course.Unfortunately, the combination of multiple lecturers within one part of a lesson (often with highly varying accents, reading verbatim from lecture notes) makes the presentation of the course material come off as very stiff, over-directed, and hard to understand. Its hard to adapt to the idiosyncrasies and lecturing style of a new person in a four minute video, at which point you get a whole new lecturer and have to start the process over again.A maximum of two or three lecturers for the entirety of the course (perhaps with the occasional guest speaker) would be helpful. Also, either allowing the them to deliver the course material in their native languages with English subtitles, or perhaps having them record the course material in English in something similar to a classroom environment where theyre accustomed to lecturing, would make things infinitely easier to follow.This too many cooks in the kitchen issue is what I also suspect happened with the week one quiz. I do not know who generates the quiz questions but they seemed to require a lot of mental gymnastics for a multiple choice quiz. Perhaps on my end there could be a cultural misunderstanding in how a quiz checks your knowledge of the source material?

"Nice course! The teaching is excellent (5 stars), and I have learned a lot in this course. It is short but intensive.I initially planned to give only 2 or 3 stars because of several reasons, described below. But in the end I like the course a lot so I dont want to go too low.Reasons are:1) Strobe, the software synth required in the course, was hardly usable (crashing always in 64 bit mode, sometimes in 32 bit mode). Several applicants stopped the course because of this. However this was (at least for me) solved during the course (I can use it now without any problems). So that is great (but a bit late).2) The course is (as of March 2016) new and still contains many errors. The videos, as said, are excellent. But the assignments are often wrong and not accurate (actually 4 out of 4 contain errors...). In the first assignment you are asked to list favorites in 14 categories, but there are only 13. So you can never get the full points, or the reviewers should be flexible. In many of the following assignments the naming of the to be uploaded files is unclear or erroneous. It is important to fix that because reviewers are explicitly asked if the names are correct. In the third assignment it is worse, there is no room for an upload of the MP3, the final product of your whole week work which should be judged. One error was fixed during the course but in a hasty way, the most important errors are still there. Anyway, that will hopefully be fixed before the next cycle starts.3) The course is really targetted to House (or at least Dance) music. All assignments should follow a predescribed form, while I (as an amateur classical pianist) would like to create pieces not following that form, but still using synth sounds. But if you do that, you get less points or do not pass the assignments. So that is too strict (in my opinion).4) Strobe2 is central in the course. It is mainly educating for Strobe2. I tried after the course to apply the knowlegde to other synth plugins, which is possible but only in a limited way. You really learn how to do it in Strobe2, and there is no education for other synth plugins. Many concepts cannot easily be transferred. That is different from Loudons excellent course Music Production, which was designed to be software independent.So I have several objections to the course. But some of them can be fixed, and it was still a great course, I learned a lot and I enjoyed it, and I give it 4 stars.",1.0,0,1,1,0,0.0,0,0,0

In a nutshell, he is AWESOME!What I did not like, which is also why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is mainly due to organisational matters:1) the course schedule does not follow the weeks as listed in Coursera which creates TOTAL confusion, and it can be very easily solved. At the very least, the mid-term and final exams should be placed after the correct weekly schedule. Right now it is shifted by a week (earlier)2) The instructions about the peer assignments were not fully clear. I think also there, this is a quick fix and quick win. Simply adjusting the wording to better explain the process would help reduce questions on the forum.3) There was almost no staff involvement in the forum. The responses were very far in between, which also made the forum discussions not as lively or exciting. I would have loved having the professor himself on the forum, or at least one of his assistants in the forum, sparking discussions, responding to threads etc. This was almost on existent.So in short, I would highly recommend the course due to its content! But I also feel that there are organisational improvements, which if made, would make this course a true 5 star course!",1.0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0,0,0

"The course is a great introduction into Bayesian statistic analysis. I particularly liked the detailed explanations of where the parameter formulas came from. Also a great thing, in my opinion, was to write the explanations on the glass instead of just displaying the final results. It kind of provided a sense of interactivity and made the material more digestible for a person with not such a strong background in math. It greatly smoothed the learning curve for me and kept interested and motivated to finish the course. In the end the pace accelerated a bit but was still manageable. Four weeks seems a great duration for such a course - not becoming boring and tiring. Honors tests were quite easy, Id prefer to have a little more challenge.

"In general, an excellent course, taught by competent professors. I believe that in the main this course does very well in achieving its objective of knowledge transfer. However, having experienced it, there were parts where the professor was demonstrating a topic using a video presentation showing him operate a process or screen sequence on his computer. These aspects, like virtually all the material on this course, are of a technical nature and contain many important details. As such, to help complete and re-enforce their learning, students require something like a sequence of slides that they can print out and retain for revision and future reference. In certain parts, the provision of the printable screenshots in the form of slides was absent.An important theme of the course and Data Science in general is Reproducible Research. What Im arguing for here is, Reproducible Learning Materials covering a complete course, not only parts of it. Admittedly, it was only a very small proportion of the course that suffers from this defect. But I would not like it to become the norm in the future. As a suggestion, it could be possible to author a lecture using HTML so as to combine the verbatum lecture text with every slide/screenshot image embedded in its right position within the lecture.I notice Coursera courses have also moved away from the weekly lists of individual lectures together with their links to .txt, .mp4, etc. files. The new presentation keeps you submerged within the flow within each weeks series of lectures. One has to click out in order to watch your progress and then re-enter the lectures at a resumption point. I prefer the previous navigation structure in order to access lectures and materials.

People often wonder how a process or a product gets from A to B where it goes from open access to access for a limited few.

This, in my point of view, is not a minus (however, Im am used to such an approach given a PhD background). One point of improvement: all theory is accompanied by case-studies and practical examples. Most of them, however, are drawn from the US experience and reality - none really from an international perspective (with the exceptions of the Cuba missile crisis and of Google - an international icon anyhow).

"Having almost completed this course, I can say that this course provides a basic over view of the concepts of ML. Quality and content are lacking. The professors, breeze thru the concepts in few short videos. No further guidance is available. You are on your own.While the quizzes test the concepts learned, no live help is available. Again, you are on your own.1. Some course materials should be provided other than basic fancy power point slides. The lectures dont do justice to the material content and quizzes. Some reference materials or write ups would be greatly helpful.2. Teaching assistants or moderators should be made available for each course to help out with any conceptual or programmatic questions. Students are left to collaborate amongst themselves and figure out a solution. For a paid course, I expect some real professional help.Many a times, I had to turn to google to help me out if I was stuck at a problem or didnt understand a concept.

"The content of the course is amazingly rich. Ive particularly appreciated all the interviews.The science was also very interesting, although at the end (starting from week 4 if I remember well), the result dont seem so convincing. But it is still really amazing. (May I suggest to try to use Machine Learning algorithm to analyze the huge amount of result from the retreat project, they are getting pretty good at facial recognition and analysis.)The contemplative labs were an interesting plus.The only caveats is that, although the content presented by Germano and Schaeffer is amazing (and precious to me), I think they could improve the presentation. I would suggest to consult with a specialist in communication who will be able to point out what could be improved and how. I feel that without that, the communication objective will fail (as reported by most students including myself). Here are a few points I have noticed. Complex background create a distraction, especially when the reading is monotonous, its preferable to have simple neutral background, like a library. Reading in a monotonous voice is not engaging for the viewer. Dandling around and all sort of gestural distractions dont help us focusing on the content. Sentences are too long and use too many technical words, two things that any communicator will immediately suggest to drop especially if you are targeting a large audience. In one video the background was nice (a forest), yet the noise of the bird were too loud compare to the voice. Plus there was many cut in this video and almost every time the camera had moved from its previous position creating yet another distraction. But dont get me wrong, I have appreciated this content, I just felt that it needed a huge investment from my part to be able to grab it into memory and learn from it. This is the reason why I havent graded this course with 5 stars.

"I base my ratings of courses on 3 things:1) Is the material clear? 3/5Yes, for the most part, though the lecturer sometimes gets mixed up and uses terms like class / object the wrong way.2) Can I generalize from the material to other applications? 2/5This module spends a lot of time on C before you get to Objective-C specific material, so you dont get much Objective-C. Theres a bit of a tour of XCode, but its not particularly comprehensive. The apps you build are incredibly basic, and theres no real discussion of how to generalize from them.3) Is the course presented in an engaging way? 1/5This course is super boring. If you already know C, a lot of the content is a waste of time, but I imagine that if you dont know C this is not a good way to pick it up.So overall 2/5One other thing - the assignments are graded in a pretty bizarre way. You have to take a screencap video of your code and your app in action, upload the video, and then wait for another person to enroll in the course and review your submission.

"Ive been struggling with the learning process since high school. Over the years Ive initially approached the chance to learn with enthusiasm and determination (this time it will be different), only to be derailed by unwavering perfectionism and the steadfast conviction that I cant possible live up to expectations (if Im not perfect, then it doesnt mean anything). Ive fled more often than not, taking a fail or missing an opportunity rather than face the possibility of being merely average, or worse. So taking Learning How to Learn was not just about understanding the process of learning from a tactical point of view, but showing that I could follow my goal all the way through to the end.Fortunately Learning How to Learn provides a very supportive environment in which to learn and, importantly, make mistakes, without the whole world come tumbling down. The purpose of the course is not to identify the good learners from the bad learners, but to provide everyone with the chance to learn in a non-competitive way. As someone who has feared learning for a long time, it was incredibly, monumentally important that Learning How to Learn be a place to enjoy the process of learning, rather than the outcome of it. And thats what the course provided.Im going to be testing the ideas and strategies from Learning How to Learn over the next few months, leading up to the start of my second year at university.

"Now that I have completed the course Id like to give some feedback on how I think it was.1. Quizzes are horrible. The fact we get no feedback on incorrect answers is not very helpful. There are only 3 quizzes where I missed just one question but no matter what, I cant get them correct. It would be helpful if there was some explanation why an answer your selected was wrong, a hint or something. Also while some of the quiz answers are obvious from watching the lessons, some are totally not and if someone doesnt have ANY programming experience I think they would find some questions almost impossible to answer. I have a programming background and out of all the quizzes I just missed 1 question on 3 of them, but Ive been trying to answer them again, and again, and again and I just cant get them right. If there was feedback after taking a quiz Im sure it would of helped. For those 3 quizzes, I took them so many times all the other answers are memorized and I just keep trying to get that one right. Its not helpful and then it turns into a just keep selecting different things until its right thing instead of understanding it.2. The course says its for beginners to programming but I beg to differ. I think the way the material is presented and how the assignments are laid out I do not think someone(or not many people) would have gotten through that Week two ascii assignment. I thought they assignments in some cases were harder than the lessons. Maybe its because they way they were explained in the lessons which brings me to #33. I do not think the instructors use the best/most clear examples to present the material to students. There are many easier examples to teach about looping than showing an Ascii art example. Because not only does the student have to grasp the concept of loops, then also have to think about ascii print logic. I think to someone with no experience would get pretty lost pretty quickly in this course. Some of the things explained in the lessons I would actually look up other videos of other people explaining it to get a clearer picture.4. Some material is not consistent. Like in some assignments the text is wrong, for the Account code example, you never really mention the mOut or the interface the class uses which are in the example files and what to do with them when you write the other constructors (The course goes over this later when talking about the constructors and calling a constructor from another constructor but not that early on when youre working with the Account example files5. It seems this course really isnt fully developed yet and is still going through its growing painsOverall, I would say there are many other courses that are far better at teaching the basics of Java. For me, since I do have some Java experience and a programming background it wasnt too bad, But Im thinking of the guy who has never touched a line of code before. I just dont think the course does a good enough job at explaining things to someone like that.I really hope the next courses in the specialization are better organized than this because starting with the next course because the next ones are more important to me than this course was only because of my prior background",1.0,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"This capstone project is a bad joke and Im gonna tell you why!First, ESSEC TAs were never available! We had to contact Coursera several times for weeks to get a simple yet not helpful reply from ESSEC. And it was too late for anything, really... Remember, the whole project lasts for 4 weeks only!Second, several documents required for the weekly assignments were missing! Its fair to say we were all free-styling (i.e. making wild assumptions) our ways through the entire capstone due to lack of necessary information.Third (and most importantly). most of the participants didnt have any basic business background whatsoever. Be prepared to get a bad grade from someone whos clueless about hotel business, not to mention revenue or demand management. That really makes you wonder how these people even passed the last three core courses....Forth, this capstone is great for those who just want to get a certificate for the sake of having a certificate. Did you notice those 4 or 5 star ratings with no written reviews? Yeah, they were probably trying to show their appreciation for the easy certificate. After all, its easy to walk away with a decent grade when theres no one knows whats going on. ANYTHING GOES! However, if you are a serious learner who wants to actually learn something, run away from this capstone.

I have been following this course since mid 2015 and I found it very good. But because of my busy schedule I usually switch the session. But this time I am really motivated to devote some time for this great course to learn OOP. I have learned a lot in my university about java programming but they did not teach us these stuff which are practiced. we solved a lot of problems there but they had nothing much about using java libraries and OOP.

"Wonderful course! Its simple and absolutely well and clearly explained. Summary, systematization and selection of knowledge, as well as its division into units, is flawless. I have never taken such an understandable course by such an understanding professor. Moreover, all speakers participating and the Professor himself are genuinely interested in the subject , its theorizing, and its beneficial practical applications. You can feel they care about, and demand, professional and decision maker honesty and ethics. This is what makes you love a subject.

"Well, while I felt really frustrated after having played ALL of this course videos, I have first put very negative comments here for its reviewing. I have then been kindly asked to reconsider my comments under the light of the usefulness of this course to some audience. For sure, it might be that I was not of the attended audience. And I still think that this course was of no interest to me - this is the reason why Im still pleased not to have paid for its useless certificate. Nevertheless, this course might be of interest for some students. This is definitively true. So, let me suggest a new title for it: Design and Make Infographics for the Dummies. Because thats it! This course is definitively perfect for the ones who know nothing about Infographics and they might enjoy it. Finally, I shall neither modify nor remove my previous comments on the examples used by the author.Please notice that Coursera still gets all my confidence about the usefulness and the quality of their proposed courses. For instance, just have a look to the course Machine Learning of one of its co-founders, Andrew Ng.------------------------------------My previous comments here below:For sure I was not the correct audience for this course. But nothing useful to be learned in here. Karl Gude is too much speaking of what he has formerly done, which is of only interest to him. I dislike the examples he uses : violence, sex, illness, accidents, weapons, war, drugs - and fruits, ok. Are these the only topics of interest to him? Finally, it appears that the $45 certificate does not worth it. Im pleased not to have paid for it. And I definitively not recommend this course.

"The course was very basic. It was nicely taught and the examples and the lectures were really enjoyable. However, some shortcomings I felt were that the colors in the slides could have been a bit clearer.

A real beginner would not be able to understand them which would in some parts defeat the purpose of the course.Other than that, I felt the course was really structured well. The assignments were easy and the quizzes did test the knowledge about the subject taught so far.

"The course did an excellent job of providing a broad overview of mountains, from many interesting and important perspectives. So it was completely successful in its primary goal as a 101 course. I also really enjoyed the map section. It was a good decision to bring in different experts to add variety to the videos.Some constructive feedback:The quiz questions need some polish, in particular, the select all that apply questions. Also, because Coursera randomizes the order of answers, some choices like all of the above simply do not work.The course notes could easily be improved with some nicer formatting. They also do not always cover every question on the quiz, which would be nice for students who want to revisit parts they got wrong or didnt feel solid on.I believe that the tech tips will only be useful for a very small number of viewers. The idea of a quick tip on a related topic to the weeks lesson probably sounded great, but the end result was far too superficial to be of any use. For example, instead of listing various navigation equipment and telling viewers to practice before heading out, it would have been more helpful to just pick one and give pointers on how to use it correctly.The sections of video where David is talking with an expert are very awkward. I know its surprisingly hard to pull off, but those scenes really should have been rewritten when it was clear how wooden the interaction was. The question and answers are very unnatural, and the slow walking toward the camera is so clearly contrived as to be distracting. At the very least, fade the scene in with them already walking, rather than have a beat with them just standing still before starting their next take.That last point isnt a big deal, of course. Students didnt take the course to see great acting. And in general, the videos were good enough. But the production values can only slip so much before flaws begin calling attention to themselves and begin to distract from the material. Maybe one final point on the videos; Zac, was generally able to read the script more naturally, but Davids earnestness endeared him to me more.As I said at the top, I think Mountains 101 largely succeeded at what it set out to do, and I am glad I took it. Some polish on a few areas would have improved my experience somewhat, but even as is, I would recommend this course to others. Thanks for doing it! I can only imagine how many hours on the script and in front of the greenscreen David and Zac must have spent.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

"This course has great videos. I give it such a low rating to get your attention and point out some serious problems. This is a certification course in how to teach English as a second language. What was not apparent to me though is that you have to take 2 parts of the specialization before getting certified and it will take over a year! Also, there is close to no teacher participation in the module I took and there are no mentors or student teachers (that might change in future classes I would hope, but no guarantees) and there was close to zero feedback of my work or even in the discussion area and no authoritative feedback. Even the peer reviews require your classmates ONLY to judge you based on whether you actually tried to answer the question, if it was between one and three paragraphs and one other silly thing that I cant even remember now. No one is required to give actual feedback and a lot of the assignments were written by students in horrendous English, but that is not to be considered. With so many people taking this course for whom English is not a first language, even these very simple instructions were often misunderstood and people had problems with getting credit for their assignments. Also, even though the videos are really well-done, they are short and contain little information for the price. I figured that I was paying about $50 an hour for the lectures at regular speed. There are also little to no resource links etc. for further study so the lectures are pretty much the only thing you get. If you are a native English speaker who doesnt mind spending an entire year and the cost for well-done videos on the subject is not important, then this course if for you. If however you think this is going to cost only $200 and you would have interaction with teachers and you would get a certification in about half a year... I want to make sure you realize, that is NOT what this specialization is! If you are NOT a native English speaker, this course is designed well I think for people who do not speak English as a native language, who might even have a low level of English, yet who are teaching English already in foreign countries and would have difficulty acquiring certification any other way and therefore dont mind taking a full year to complete the course or the price and for whom not having someone give them feedback would be considered an asset. I have recommended it to friends who are not native speakers of English, but as a native speaker I found it slow, expensive and the assignments to be actually annoying. Its perfect though for my foreigner friends... as long as they understand its real length and cost! THE CERTIFICATION WILL TAKE OVER A YEAR AND COST AROUND $400.",0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"While the subject matter was extremely relevant, I didnt think this course was taught well. Much of the lecture and exercise focused on providing direction than actually teaching. I felt as though I was just copying and pasting sample code. At times it was as though the professor was rushing to introduce new modules rather than discussing how and why certain concepts should be used. In most cases, I could have learned the Ionic modules just as well by reading the documentation and looking at sample code, which is often what this course felt like. Id have much rather seen the concepts explained in more detail than rushing to add new modules without any context.The quizzes are not challenging (the professor always puts the correct answer as the first choice) and the exercises just provide cut/paste code snippets without any reasoning or explanation.

Only after a while we understand their use. This bring a lot of overhead to us who are learning.Some videos seem to have been re-worked over time and present cuts or jumps.As for assignments, they should be better worked because some questions are not clear or misleading regarding the criteria that you want to evaluate.For example, I already reported that in Question 2. and 3. of the assignment for the 3rd week. The example you give is a short introduction with two problems: 1) I did the website, which can make the participant not to be at ease to criticize and 2) were no evaluating the participant performance but the website. Next, you ask us to rewrite the introduction, which we do with those two problems in mind.

"This planning course was slightly better than the preceding landscape course, but it was still underwhelming. The instructor seemed better prepared with her presentation, but her dependence on the textbook and speaking style still made it seem as if she lacked mastery of the subject. The course did touch on the important subject matters at hand, but since the textbook was so old (practically outdated by digital media standards), it missed or made little mention of so many innovations and best practices that are now the rule for digital marketers. For example, the increasingly crucial role of marketing automation platforms like HubSpot, Dynamics Marketing and Marketo and how CRMs like SalesForce and Dynamics are driving both marketing and sales strategy. Another example is how email marketing has moved to rules-based and triggered workflows. Again, theres a definite need for this course. I would actually recommend breaking out social, SEO and online advertising into their own courses, rather than squeezed into small segments. Finally, the putting it all together section is vital for anyone who wants to work in digital marketing, but the coverage here was much too general.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

It was the first time I ever got a B in Math, and ruined my love for the subject. Since then, I had all but abandoned my love for the subject because I thought I had a learning deficiency for Calculus. It turns out that my teacher was just sub-par, or leagues below Dr. Fowler. As someone who is strong with numbers, he is the perfect professor to bring out the conceptual learning student in me. The most impressive thing though is how he has delivered rules to me in an almost photographic format. After each lesson, which are all theoretical then provide graphical and numericalnexamples,I do one practice problem with what I absorbed and check the answer. It is normally incorrect, but after reading the correct answer and explanation I fly through the next five.

"This course -- actually, both the 2nd and 3rd courses in this specialization -- are like take your interested, but mostly uninformed friend to work day. Give them some stacks of paper to sort, then shown them what a correctly sorted stack looks like. Youve only got one day at work with your friend, so be kind enough to humor them with a very cursory explanation of what sorting is about, but you cant really teach them much in such a short time. So, set them to task, sorting pile after pile. Hey look! Your friend is now a practiced sorter!These courses are really for folks who can spend much more time than advertised. Sure, you will see lots of really cool things -- like AngularJS, Grunt, Bower, etc. -- but dont come into this believing that youll really learn them, because that is just not possible with the time allowed. This whole thing is about exposure, not deep understanding.Want to learn the guitar? This is like going to watch a (very slow) concert, and then having the guitarist hand you their instrument, put your fingers on the correct frets, and then strum the strings for you. See -- now you can play!Thinking of learning algebra? How about if I simply told you to write the numeral 5, then the addition symbol, then the letter X, then the equals symbol, and finally the numeral 12, and then proceeded to tell you, step-by-step, what you should write on the page in order to solve for X. Would you have learned about solving equations? At most, you would have written a workable example for solving a certain kind of equation, but I doubt youd be anywhere near proficient after being hand-held through one example.On the positive side, I was exposed to many different things in the web-development world -- that I cannot argue against. However, this course could be so much more.

"About two years ago I completed Dr. Mines course Data Analysis and Statistical Inference and was quite impressed by it. I always hoped that thered be a follow up on bayesian statistics, so I was really excited when I heard that a course on this topic had finally been created. However while attending the course I became more and more disappointed. Dr. Mine does a nice job explaining things, other teachers in this course arent as talented. Most slides / videos are quite useless for teaching because they skip over important steps without giving appropriate explanations. Also I was quite disappointed that this course pretty much only focuses on conjugate priors. MCMC is only skimmed over and the introduction to MCMC is more than questionable - instead of showing a simple example, MCMC is squeezed into the topic of bayesian model selection. Another point is R - this course doesnt really teach bayesian stats with R. It teaches how to call one-liners like bayes_inference (from package statsr) or bas.lm (from package BAS) instead of lm. This is totally disappointing. I wish this course would skim over conjugate prior methods and then focus on MCMC sampling methods by teaching how to build interesting and practically useful models using JAGS/STAN/PyMC/whatever.

"This is the introductory course to a series of courses designed to teach machine learning through case studies. The introductory course provided a nice overview of key machine learning techniques in the context of common applications of machine learning (case studies).

"This is a great course. The concepts and techniques taught here should be required by every teacher and student in our school systems from kindergarten on. Of course, some of the material is well beyond the grasp of a kindergartner, but the techniques and methods can be taught by how their teacher manages the delivery of curriculum. It is never too early to teach our children how to learn.This is a wonderfully succinct presentation of key concepts that I wish had been available to me in my youth. I was very fortunate to have an anatomy and physiology professor in college in 1979 that took time in his lectures to teach about how the brain learns and some methods and principles for study, retention, and recall. I saw many of his concepts in this course.I later went on to teach college myself. I found the students in my Freshman course on data communications were particularly lazy about making an effort to learn material thoroughly. I knew this bad habit would hinder their progress in the semesters to come.I adopted a practice of making my mid-term exam a thorough (not to be confused with level of difficulty) test of their understanding. Consequently, 60% would fail that test. When delivering the bad news I also delivered a path to recovering from that score. I provide several hours of lecture on what I learned about learning from my A&P professor. Then I offered a retest. The questions were posed differently in wording and type (multiple choice vs short answer essay vs T/F). Everyone improved their score significantly and the pass/fail distribution reflected more of a bell curve distribution.Interestingly, when I tried teach how to learn before the mid-term I still saw a 60% failure rates. I expect somethings require more motivation. The risk of failing a course proved to be motivating, so I capitalized on that human behavior. I wish I could have found a better way, because this approach cost several lecture hours of data communications instruction. However, teaching them to learn proved so much more valuable.I, unexpectedly had the same high failure rate on a term test teach an Algebra class. I responded in kind with lectures on how to learn. On student that started with failing the first term test almost dropped. Another student that had taken other classes encouraged her stay on and to learn how to learn. She finish Algebra with an A-.

It was such a nice experience to learn something new, or even if some aspects I learned it before but I have gained a tremendous, in-depth knowledge and solid foundation about this course: like the use of metaphors, the Grassers theory of intrinsic motivation, the Vygostkys scaffolding, Body Language and the teachers talk, the i+1 learning, the 80/20 rule, the diffuse mode and focused mode of learning and more!. And one thing that I really enjoyed more was the assumptions or the essential questions in the assignment which involved critical thinking. Thank you so much for this course, and to all the staff who created this language learning website, to the staff behind the scene and especially to Dr. Shane Dixon thank you for generously sharing your knowledge and expertise on this field.

"This course is a perfect one for people who are beginning to take their first steps in the world of Python (and programming, in general).. All the lectures, assignments, and the course materials offer quite good insight to basic and fundamental programming concepts..And, considering the syntactical ease of Python, it makes programming easy to learn and understand, removing the extra clutter found in the more traditional languages like C/C++ or Java,,And, finally, the instructor, Prof. Charles Severance, who is more affectionately called Dr. Chuck just mixes fun and learning to create quite an exciting and memorable teaching environment,But, while all of this good, I felt that this course lacked the bite for a more advanced learner or someone who has spent sometime in the world of programming.. The complexity of the quizzes or the assignments are at beginner level... Best for complete beginners..But, like i mentioned earlier, it is very easy to rush the whole course in a couple of days time or at most, one week for an advanced learner.This course lays the foundation for the more advanced courses in Python.. Technically, it is the first part of the Programming for Everybody specialization, which consists of 5 courses, revolving around the world of Python..So, my final advice to all beginners is to take their sweet time understanding and grasping these fundamental concepts,, These form the foundation stone for any programming language as well as Computer Science world. Dont worry about the assignments, you will get more than ample time to complete them and succeed in them..Plus, I feel that you will also enjoy some of the bonus interviews.. They could be quite motivating or thought-provoking..And, for advanced beginners, you can rush through this course and brush up on some basic concepts to move into more advanced courses, which will not only be a lot more challenging and catering more advanced and diverse concepts and topics..And, in my opinion, this specialization package could be, at this current moment, the best possible experience when compared to learning the basics of Python online.. And, could be the closest thing to a face-to-face learning experience..",0.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

"I thought the course had good overall information and provided an online mapping tool using ArcGIS despite access and technical issues which I recorded in the forums. I felt getting rushed at the end of the course for the major map project and peer review and final exam all in the last week. The map project itself should be Week 3, peer review Week 4, then final exam Week 5. All students should use the same ArcGIS Online too for the final map project, instead of allowing everybody a free-for-all to use whatever map tool they wanted to including images. I was steered to be more lenient in reviewing submissions of simple PDF or image map without interactive content. This made for an awkward and rushed peer review with little time to address access or technical issues. The final map project should be standardized for all students using ArcGIS Online for an equal playing field and applied learning.",1.0,0,1,1,0,1.0,0,0,0

"the contents of the course were very good. It is essential material that everyone should learn about as early as possible in their life. It should be essential learning in each school. All the material is based on scientific facts. there are, however, reasons why I did not rate this course with 5 points. The amount of material takes a lifetime to digest and adopt. To cram this into a few weeks was not the appropriate way to teach it. there were way too many videos one was supposed to watch within a single week. Sometimes even the summary videos for a single week took 20 minutes. That is just not right. I was so busy memorizing the material that I did not find the time to adopt it in my daily life. what a pity. it will take me many months to really digest the material",1.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

With this course (and the following courses) I think I have finally gained a DEEPER understanding of some of the basic but very important concepts of statistics.

There is only little background to R as a programming language and the different types of data, lists, matrices etc. To me thats a good thing, as it allows you to use R right away (which in turn makes me more motivated to go back and learn more about R).I whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone who wants to understand and use statistics!",0.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0
"This course has appealing assignments and covers interesting topics. The course, however, has two fatal flaws. First, the lectures are a bit disjointed. While there is much to learn in the lectures, the lecturers style is a bit halting and scattered (it would have been much better presented if the lecturer had a script to read off of.) As is, the lectures are mediocre, which is unfortunate since the lecturer is clearly knowledgeable about the topics presented.Second, the assignments suffer from a lack of good error messaging and no support in the forums (aside from what you will find from other students, which can be very helpful at times.) The assignments themselves are a great approach to learning concepts (and you get to work with real data, like the Twitter data), but without good error messaging when you submit a script you pretty much end guessing where you are taking a wrong turn.I had high hopes for this course, but it seems as though it fails on execution.",1.0,0,1,1,1,1.0,0,0,0

"This is a great course and a daring venture for what is really an art form, beyond its scientific requirements. This part of the specialization needs a little refinement.I posted this in the discussion forum.· 7 days ago · EditedFirst of all.....these guys running this data science department have their hands full. They are teaching live classes for students who have spent OODLES (lots) of money to attend this prestigious college . Johns Hopkins is about as good as it gets for a medical degree. Then they are doing experiments and other data science for the research division of Johns Hopkins which is also as good as it gets........THEN they are doing these MOOC courses on top of all their other responsibilities......Dr. Leek is a University of Washington Alumni, which is also top notch for Data Science.The video lesson is flawed, there is no denying it. But I must say these teachers are very open to improvement in the course and your comments on what could be better done are received and acted upon, so I would include them in your thank you letter to the teachers.ALSO I think these MOOC courses are best done by all members of the department contributing. Truly this field IS a team sport. I feel this course was good, but the videos need to be edited and scripted, so unnecessary language, which dilutes the core knowledge, that must be learned, is not diluted where questions are left in the students head about content when being tested. I learned long ago in a college calculus class that if your mark isnt perfect, its OK, so long as you pass with a high score......even if it is the teachers fault. The course could use better video production with teleprompter scripting......maybe some AV students at Johns Hopkins could get on board. it will happen eventually Im sure.You want to take a course that is absolutely one of the best courses Ive taken anywhere and truly the best online. Try the number one business course on Coursera:GROW TO GREATNESS, either part 1 or 2, University of Virginia, Darden School Of Business...........A team created course with one helluva a teacher who is a business person, researcher and award-winning writer. I would recommend this course to ANY student and especially E-Teachers.The problem with this course is that there is a lot of information that can be included but may not be absolutely necessary as a core concept. Needless to say, the more technical skills any employee has, the more insight they will have into their teammates skills, as well, as the overall mission of the data department and the business it serves. Im more of a tech and infrastructure person, Im not real passionate about coding. I find it tedious. The more I learn about it, the more I enjoy it, albeit, from a distance. I cant see myself creating great blocks of scripts, but the more I know about how they are created AND what rules the code in a project must abide by, the better my skills will be as a data center manager. So Im trying to learn as much as possible about R, Python, and companion programs like ggvis for creating visualizations. Id say visualizations are an essential skill for a data manager, since you have to present results and projects, questions, and answers to higher ups and other departments.this link comes from the resource section of this course:https://www.datacamp.com/courses/ggvis-data-visualization-r-tutorialThis link or URL is of much more value to me, than a flawed test question and a reduction in my 100 percent average in the specialization.Without this lesson, in this course, I would not have this valuable resource.Another great link, which has a great FREE print publication as well:http://www.processor.com/ ...these people have been advising data center managers longer than just about anybody !Verbally and in the transcript are some nebulous statements that point toward the main idea, that concept being: the more any employee, on any data science or technical team member IS, a jack of all trades, the better. So that could have been included in some more general way on the quiz, because really that is pretty much a general rule, Ive found, working in ANY capacity in the tech industry. I have done a great deal of audio editing, working at numerous radio stations, with Adobe Audition. With others like: Pro Tools, or any other really good quality AV digital editor the result is streamlined, near seamless, audio-video, or one or the other. You just learn how to read and edit wave forms of all kinds.Years ago, in Dallas, Texas, attending Richland College. I learned a valuable lesson. I was taking a college level Calc-Trig math class being taught by the regular professors WIFE. I dont know if the professor was sick, but this woman, who was teaching the class for the whole semester, frankly, was not qualified. I had always been considered an illiterate by my high school math teachers, a married couple who, frankly, were highly abnormal even on the geekiest scale. These people were acting like they were a world above most people in the class. Needless to say, I assumed, by their adult opinions, they were sent by God Himself, to educate me thru denigration.I was amazed, how 10 years later, in College math how well I was doing. I was carrying a 100 percent average ! So midterm this faux professor declares, Ill be prefiguring all the arithmetic to be easy, so you wont have to bring your calculators !SO I DIDNT.......and of course the teachers wife proclaims.....I didnt have time to make the arithmetic easy so youd better use your calculators ! I literally had pages and pages of figuring in handwriting accompanying my 3 page test. The result was a C plus on the test. I angrily told the sub teacher I did not bring a calculator to this test because you said it wouldnt be necessary, therefore I must be allowed to redo this test with a calculator ! She of course relented, No that wont be possible...thats not a bad grade.... she continued, what are you worried about ?........I was so peeved, I was going to drop the class. It was too late in the semester, and I was so disgusted with this womans cavalier dismissal of my perfect grade that I just stopped going to class. The result was a failing final grade.Who ultimately suffered from this dilemma ? That, albeit, unfairly was me.....who created this academic tragedy, by the aggravation of a deeply flawed situation. Once again, that would be me.",1.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,1,1,1

I appreciate the excellent quality of the chosen materials, but, if it becomes compulsory to spend more than US $100 for buying books, then the total cost of this Specialization elevates quite a lot, given that I had to pay €162 for it. On my opinion, there should be at least a note in the description of both the Specialization and the Courses about these requirements, in order to make an informed decision before enrolling.The second downside has to do with Course 1 and Course 2 overlapping materials. Im referring to guest interview videos. Thats mainly a problem of the 2nd Course, as there are almost no guest interviews in this Course, and the one interview provided is already available in Course 1. I understand that the topics discussed apply to the topics of both Courses, but, still, I find it an unnecessary repetition.The last problem is about the dates that the Courses are run. Course 1 runs during a given period, Course 2 is on demand, but it makes sense to attend it before Course 3, that also runs during a given period, which overlaps with the period of the 1st Course. Sorry, this makes it very difficult to attend everything and to seriously focus, as its always about running for deadlines, especially when one has to produce three (3) Board Effectiveness Assessment Reflection (BEAR) papers :( .",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

"Overall, this is a very effective introduction to AngularJS. AngularJS can be intimidating or confusing, and this course is largely an introduction, but the videos and exercises do a great job of letting you get over the initial learning curve. This course will give you a thorough foundation in AngularJS, way better than any other free course online, and will give you an idea of where you can go off and explore on your own if youre interested in going on to develop intermediate skills.My only critique of this course is that I really had to explore the additional materials at the end of each section to get a grasp of some of the concepts. I found that some of the videos oversimplified pretty complicated subjects and werent thorough enough to allow you to complete some of the exercises. I also think the course briefly introduces some pretty complicated tools too early to new developers and doesnt do a good job of explaining their value (like Grunt and Gulp).However, this course is still amazing for a free course. If youve done any of the quick tutorials in AngularJS (like codeacademys), youve really only scratched the surface of AngularJS. A hands-on course like this give you a much better foundation.

"I enjoyed and benefitted from some of this course. In particular I would highly recommend the Meditation Labs, the Science of Meditation videos and the short presentations from the Tibetan Buddhist monks . But I think the creators of this course need to be a lot clearer about what their aims are in that part of the course which Dr Germano presented. Since this was he was presenting the main overview of Buddhist content it was particularly disappointing that his presentations were so bad.I understand that there were difficulties in getting the course up and running from the various delays in its starting date and the change to its title and perhaps Dr Germanos role was more affected than the other lecturers. However its pretty damning when he manages to to be so off-putting to so many of the students, going on the discussion comments. For my own part, Ive studied and practiced Buddhism for more than 30 years and I am left with little sense of what his aims were for his lectures.To be more specificDr Germanos Presentation:-he read from what I presume were lecture notes but more likely he was reading from an academic paper. the language was pretty turgid.-he could have just provided a PDF of his paper / notes for us to download. That would have been much more helpful as presumably it would have had some structure to it. doing that would have enabled him to use his video time in a more creative way.-MOOCs are wonderful audio-visual opportunities but he had no slides or illustrations at all. The few text headers which appeared then disappeared in only a very few seconds and sometimes did not relate directly to what he was saying at that time.Dr Germanos content: the amended title was Tibetan Buddhist Meditation. This is a complex subject which encompasses many layers of meditation practice culled from historically earlier Buddhist traditions. Can I suggest that any future version of this course includes the following:-include a video which presents the main aspects of the historical development of Buddhism. There was some mention of this in Germanos material but he did it from the Tibetan point of view. Surely what a modern day presentation needs is a modern impartial historical analysis of the subject. Its not as if there arent plenty of academics and practitioners who are active in this field.-its confusing to describe Tibetan Lesser Vehicle practices but then illustrate them with Pali text sources, modern Mindfulness practice, and modern Brahma Vihara practice all of which have emerged from the modern Theravadin tradition.-its also perplexing to include information about many modern Theravadin teachers (Sayadaw, Goenka) in a course apparently not about them.Dont get me wrong, I enjoyed the videos about Sayadaw and the interview with Sharon Saltzberg, but I am left in the dark about just what differences, if any, there are between them and Tibetan meditation.Overall I think this course was offered prematurely.

"First. I like these courses allot. They are pretty close to covering just what you need to actually do machine learning in the real world and not dive too deep into topics that have no practical value.However:This course was a bit too thin, the last 4 weeks of the course contained little in depth informations and seemed to brush over allot of different topics that could have contained more information. Although they where important topics the course could go more in depth on at least 3 or 4 of those topics. The last 3 weeks could have been a course on its own if properly explored. However the concepts are well enough covered to be usable in practice i belive.The programming exercises where ridiculously simple. Everything was reduced to filling in 1 or two lines in a bigger function. I understand that the point was to see how these functions are made and that it increases our understanding of the algorithms already existing in packages like schikit-learn and graphlab. Also the content became a bit too repetetive (actually started in the second course but continues in this course). The time used on variation over the same topic in different models made it challenging to pay attention when the lecture finally came to a new point (brain fell a sleep while waiting for something new).",1.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

"As a capstone to a series of courses that covered data science and R, I found this one to be a bit lacking. There was no involvement from the professors at JHU or the folks at SwiftKey. As was mentioned in another review, the course feels abandoned. All you get a few short (two minutes or so) videos that give you little in the way of instruction or direction. Basically, they just say, Go do this. Good luck!There were also no Mentors or TAs to guide students or answer questions. It was the students helping each other through the forums. Sometimes it was helpful and everyone involved learned something. Other times, it was the blind trying to lead the visually-impaired.On a positive note, you will use all of the skills from the previous courses: writing R functions, performing exploratory analysis and publishing it via RPubs. Your final product will be displayed for everyone via ShinyApps and a presentation using R Presentation (also published via RPubs).On a(nother) negative note, the topic of Natural Language Processing is not an easy one to just walk into and feel confident in providing a working next-word prediction algorithm in about eight (8) weeks. Youre reading academic journal articles, watching multiple videos from another Coursera course (which actually focuses on the topic of NLP, and takes place over several courses and several months!).Supposedly, there is work going on to update the course, so hopefully future students will get a better experience. I did take a bit away from this course, especially since I made more than one attempt to complete it. However, it was definitely a shock to find myself missing those things that one typically finds in a learning environment -- descriptive background, assistance to problems, etc. -- and seeing that I was for all intents and purposes on my own. Even in the professional world of data analysis, I have never experienced the lack of support that I found in this course.With that, I am giving it three (3) stars. As I said, I did learn a bit, but it was a bit of a struggle that required multiple attempts to complete. This would have been better off as a stand alone topic (which it already is by another Coursera affiliated school), or having a capstone course that builds on a topic more in the wheelhouse of the JHU professors: a capstone project focusing on bioinformatics or biostatistics would have been amazing in comparison to this.",1.0,0,1,0,0,1.0,1,1,1

"The biggest downside of the course is that instead of learning on open source machine learning modules (sklearn) the course offers Datos GraphLab, a proprietary piece of software that requires paid licenses to operate.To be clear, during the duration of the course students can use a student license that provides graphlab for free but this expires after a year. It seems like fine software but if you arent going to purchase a license after the class expires whats the point? Also, Graphlab is built on top of python2.7. If you are running python 3.0+ on your machine youll have to install a python 2.7 instance.Otherwise the quality is solid. The philosophical approach the professors take is to give you a taste of a variety of machine learning models. The upside is that if you want to get a taste you can. The downside the course feels pretty shallow and then the next course in the specialization -- regression -- feels like a pretty stark contrast. In general it could be argued that this is a problem with all coursera courses. How do you modulate course difficulty when you could be targeting students who are somewhere between high school kids to computer scientists?

A nice course about the MAPS approach and the typical difficulties of natural scientists and mechanical engineers when approaching the political arena and dialoguing with stakeholders.

You get the sense that content is carefully curated by someone who knows what is actually useful for doing ML in the real world. The data sets and the broad objectives for the HW sets are a good balance of not too messy or challenging, but enough practice that you come away feeling you could actually use some of this stuff on your own real problems.Cons:HW in matlab / octave :( I did all the homeworks in Python (mostly scikit-learn) instead.

Lack of transparency and accountability in addition to a lack of leadership is the real responsible of this crisis of credibility.Is for this reason that its essential to educate people around the meaning of the EU and this course fully achieves this goal. Only one point to take it into account that is regarding the feedback from peers. In my case were not quite useful, without almost no analysis and without understanding the meaning of the assignment in itself.

By the 4th week, I figured out my computers basic graphic design program, and was really enjoying playing with designs.

"Fantastic. Andrew Ng is a naturally charismatic teacher with a knack for anticipating issues which his students may encounter and assuaging them before they become sticking points for later understanding. By their nature, online courses cannot benefit from students asking questions of their instructors so it is doubly important that instructors be aware of areas which may confuse students and take anticipatory action to avoid this- this is only one of Ngs strengths. Beyond this, Ng is simply an enthusiastic instructor whose passion for his subject is contagious. He also conveys a genuine sense of understanding the students process of coming to grips with more difficult portions, often explaining what has confused him before (though, given his expertise, one may wonder just how much these areas actually give him difficulty). All things considered, the biggest disappointment is that there are not more courses available with Ng as the instructor.",0.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

There is no real consistency throughout the course, it just seems like they are throwing random concepts at you and hoping you understand.

All you are really doing is filling in the blank. They give you all this code that has already been written without actually tell you how do to that yourself or what a vast majority of it does and you have to fill in code in a couple places to make it work. But since everything else is written, you can not run the code as you write it to check your work. It will fail because the code is looking for things you havent written yet. You must write the entire assignment before you can see if the first line of code you wrote works. I find this to be a very poor teaching method.

"The professor is extremely passionate and well-informed about the subject. However it would have been a lot better if he used a more visual approach to explaining things (including graphs and diagrams).The positives about the course are:- There’s plenty of proofs for those who are so inclined. So you really get to understand what’s leading up to a particular formula.- The professor shows some very interesting applications such as showing why 22/7 and pi are not the same and constructing a bridge with only one side (harmonic tower) which is a real eye opener.- He shows you that the concepts in calculus are all deeply connected. There is not a single piece of the puzzle that does not fit with the other pieces. Getting this realization is probably one of the key value propositions of this course.- The mentors in the forums are extremely helpful and respond quickly to your queries.- You learn a lot about using formal mathematical symbols.- The questions are incredibly hard and very little in way of practice examples are provided. This forces you to up your game and really try to understand how things work. Things that are learned with a lot of hard effort are retained much better than things learned without much effort. Hence, I highly recommend this course and am grateful that I took it!If you are the kind of person who likes everything to be served cut and cleaned on a silver platter, you are not likely to enjoy this course. However, if you enjoy solving puzzles with often missing, incomplete, or poorly presented information then this course is exhilarating!The course can be improved by:1. Adding more concrete example with real numbers to show how some of the theorems work.2. Adding more graphs to show how the functions look.3. Adding more practice problems with clear explanations in case you get it wrong.4. Ensuring that exercises are in sync with the sections being presented (for example, in the middle of the course we’re asked a question which involves the Taylor series which is not presented till the last week.)5. Adding more worked out examples with detailed explanations6.

"I think this course does a pretty good of introducing JavaScript. It covers the essentials of how to create functions and implement event handlers that react to the users, which is the most common use of JS. As an introductory course, it correctly assumes some of its audience has no prior programming background. However, it is difficult to teach programming in such a short time. As an experienced programmer, I would recommend reviewing the order in which some of the concepts are presented to try to help in this aspect.I was personally hoping that the final assignment would be a bit more challenging, but it was very straightforward.

Dont just read slides to me, I can do that myself. Use videos to explain concepts, but stuff your videos with practice problems. Put more code in the videos and walk me through it. Put in mini-quizzes in the middle of videos, to keep the student aware of how they are doing in short increments.

"I am relatively experienced programmer trying to just understand the Android app development framework and solve some interesting challenges along the way. I feel the course, was very painstaking in terms of code reviewing other peoples work.If I were to break up the time I spent doing the course work, it would be as follows:30 % useful work70 % taking care of course logistics (code review, writing comments on every line of code just so that people being asked to review my work are happy). Why do we have to do so many code reviews? Not every assignment requires peoples coding style to be evaluated. It places an unnecessary time burden on people who are taking this course not as full time student. Its also reducing the total amount of knowledge that is being disseminated. We should be learning about Android for 4 more hours rather than reviewing code for other people for 4 more hours.The thing I found most frustrating is that the assignments are trying to force a particular coding style on everyone. Since I am an experienced programmer, I understand the importance of coding style, creating functions and all that. However, how I structure my code and how many comments I write are entirely my choice.Now, while I understand that the course material itself does not ask you to structure code one way or another; the review guidelines that are being given to some very inexperienced programmers, makes them believe that this is the only way things should be done.

"I have mixed feelings about this course. From a instructor and content perspective, this is by far the best. Tobias is a great teacher and he explains the concepts very nicely followed up by quizzes.What I hated about this course was the web exprience and how the final questions were set up. It gave a feeling that the intent was to get you vusrses questions that were more to see if a student has understood the concepts. Some of the multiple choice answers were borderline and a rational mind could go either way. So my suggestion is to significantly rewamp your quizzes.From a technical perspective, the system did not capture my results the first time, It graded me differently on the same set of questions (this needs to be really looked into) for example the first time I answered the question a certain way, it marked me correct, however the same answer in the next attemp was marked wrong??? This lead to a lot of confusion (and I am not saying because the numbers in the answers were changed on different attemps but the content itself was marked differently).I loved this course and would have loved to attempt the advanced strategy course however but for the above reasons will not.Its dissapointing that although the instructure and content is world class the technical glitches are too many for a student to have a seamless, learning experience.

"The course was good, but what disappointed me was that the assignments were more focused on java script and less IoT. Also the lectures were short and fast at times, the instructor would move thru the demos so quick or show pages and not provide a detail description of what we were looking at, making things very confusing. At times for example I would look at the screen he was showing on the services running or docs and I was like where do I find this in BlueMix and what does all these nodes, services, etc.. mean? None of that was explained and if they were it was at a very high level. The assignments were not honest with the time estimates. Not sure about the others but I must have spent countless hours and nights working on these with little guidance or direction which would have saved me countless of wasted hours. The forums were not monitored frequently, and when I got responses they were late as by that time I figured my issues or some of the suggestions offered were cryptic not giving me any hints or letting me know if my approach was in the right direction.Either way, this course is very hard to do while also working on a full time job and travelling. With those aspects I hope that the forums are monitored by the instructors for a quick feedback loop and the lectures are updated to be more detailed. The only way I was able to finish this was because I worked 8+ hours each day and late night, and all weekends trying to make sure I finish by the end deadline (the last thing I wanted was this being monkey on my back for the next few more weeks).The positive is that I learned about BlueMix offerings and lastly I can play around now with the Raspberry Pi and do some real IoT and less Java scripting.",1.0,0,1,0,0,1.0,0,0,1

"The course developed by Andrew Ng is quite interesting, going to the essentials in order student get the big picture and the essential tools for building the backbone of future ML applications. Of course, being confident with mathematics principles and notations will be helpful but most of the time, its not an issue if you have the minimal knowledge. What it lacks on Coursera is the next stage of this course where we could investigate further the technologies presented but in more technical way. Maybe we might see that in the future...Regarding course supports (videos, forums ...), they are of good quality and the fact Andrew used them by drawing on slides helps to have a better understanding. We could notice that there are few minor errors (eg: a j index which becomes i in J(theta) writing) and I think the technical slides on Back propagation could be improved if a dedicated slide to used mathematical notations / definitions. Sometimes, there are some errors which could induce some confusions. But these minors errors dont hide the impressive work done by Andrew.Regarding assessments, quizzes could be tricky if you dont got the spirit (not an exam habit in France) and coding exercises are well structured in order the student will focus on the core modules of the lesson and not on information flow.

The course structure was well formatted. The order of the lessons and content presented made for learning intuitive. The follow along practice queries and end of lesson practice problems were also helpful interactives for the student.However there were mistakes in the answer keys or practice problem prompts that became more frequent in the lessons towards the end of the course. This made it difficult to practice the more complicated material and queries. It was also a big time waster when as a student you were unsure whether you were answering the correct question and if so whether your answer was correct. It would also been helpful to have more open ended practice problems at the end of the course in addition to the set provided.Finally I think this course would be better split into two parts. The first part should be geared towards querying data and focusing more on just pulling data and intermediate queries. The main audience would be analyst/data professionals that have privileges to pull data but not modify data.

Particular comments about lecture content, problems, etc. have been put in every lecture.General comments, in short:1) Related to the new platform and UI design:_ It is cleaner and simpler than the previous one.

Unacceptable! No way to check most of the links we saw in slides (URLs not visible)._ Description and steps in course project appear too packed together. I prefer the former design.2) Related to content:_ The course is mainly for preparing students for the rest of data science specialization program.

I think this is clear enough in the presentation but for some reasons there are people in forums who protest the content, so maybe you should insist more in this fact._ I would like to suggest some kind of reorder of material: week 2 is all about installing a running tools and week 3 about key aspects of data analysis. Maybe you can split both types of content between wk2 and wk3 to make wk2 more appealing for not technical oriented students._ Git is a source of problems for a good portion of people.

I think this is also the first course on Coursera that didnt get 5 stars from me (not sure if Ive given 4 stars once only).So the bad parts first:Assignments are so unrealistic its unbelievable. Week 1 is doable. Week 2 is problematic if you have a complex idea, lets say its still doable, but you would certainly need more time than expected weekly hour work. Week 3 is insane. It is so out of the scope of this course. And week 4 is even worse, I had to use pen and paper and then explain only 1 of the core mechanics (even that used more than expected weekly hour work).Some of the quizzes are not fully clear if you are not a native English speaker. Sometimes I had to re-read things several times, and still wasnt sure what I was doing wrong (I realized that only after I managed to literally guess the correct answer).And most of all grading is the worst Ive seen in any course.

"I find this course excellent. It is a well balanced course in combining econometric theory and its application. The fact is that to apply econometric theory one needs to understand fair bit of econometric method (that includes matrix algebra, some properties of inner product space etc.) as well as how to apply those concepts in practice. In this respect this course does serve its purpose very well.Overall, this course focuses some fundamental aspects and properties of cross-sectional data and time series data. Therefore, it provides one a good foundation (over 8 weeks) so that one can carry out ones future quest regarding any empirical topic by oneself ! I admit that modern econometric theory develops more sophisticated techniques but all of them share one common aspect i.e. they are based on more or less the same fundamentals or properties. Indeed, this course has been designed carefully by targeting those fundamentals and properties. Thus it might be very helpful to follow the modern econometric techniques.However, this course does not talk about the panel data analysis, which share both the cross-sectional and time series properties (more or less). In my opinion it might be better to have at least additional one week session on panel data. In particular, when the data set shares both cross-sectional and time series properties, which set of properties will be dominant or how the estimation technique incorporates the variation of two dimensions (i.e. cross-sectional and time ) etc.Finally, I like to thank all the teaching members and moderators of this course.

"Very mixed feelings about this course.Generally speaking, the course lectures are informative and well organized. Mentors are reallly of great help, they are doing a great job, honestly: they are very active, they give good insights, they know the subject matter.But in the course lectures, there are occasions where concepts are used which were not formally introduced before their actual use.One example: in the lectures on probability, the first slide in the lecture talks about random processes, outcomes of random process,... On the next slide, the notion of probability of an event is introduced, but the very notion of event was never introduced. It is introduced in the accompanying book, but if it is the case that the book chapters should be read PRIOR to watching the course videos, that fact should be made clear.Further in the course on probability, some words are used interchangeably without the context making it clear why they can be used interchangeably. For instance, on some occasions, the concept of independent events is used, but then, later on, the discussion talks of independent processes. Which is which??? Is there a difference? If so, what is it? When do I need to use independent events as opposed to independent processes?The graded assignments are of varying quality. The most disturbing thing about them is that, on some occasions, concepts are used in the quiz questions (either directly in the questions and answer choices, or indirectly in the correction for the quiz after you have submitted it) that were never touched upon in the course.I have had two occasions of concepts not introduced in the course but used in the graded assignments.The first occurrence of a gap between course content and quiz questions was on a quiz question about inference. I failed the question, and understood why I failed based on the course content litterally minutes after failing the question (and one mentor actually rightly corrected me). But the question correction (the explanation text you receive after submitting, as justification for what the correct answer is) referred to the concept of two-sided hypothesis test. Where did THAT come from?? I checked and rechecked the course videos, no mention at all of it. I checked the accompanying book, and the first mention of two-sided hypothesis test is way way way further in the book, in a chapter that is entirely focusing on inference.The second occurrence was in week 4. The course lectures cover two distributions: normal and binomial. The recommended reading in the book also focus on these two distributions (the recommended reading actually skips the section on geometric distribution, if I remember well). But in one of the quiz question, there was one of the possible answers referring to the geometric distribution. If it is the case that we are supposed to know and understand about geometric distributions, then the course content should cover the subject. Or at the very least, the course lecture should mention clearly that learners are advised to read about it in the accompanying book.The guidelines for the project assignment (week 5) are not all that clear as to what is expected from the learners. Sure, there are instructions on where to find the info, what structure should be followed,... There is also a very nice example project (designed by one of the mentors), which provides a lot of useful info (how to filter missing values from variables,...).But there is no real hint as to the depth of analysis we are expected to complete. This is definitely a source of confusion, not only for me, but also for a few other learners, from what I gathered in the discussion forums. The result is that the projects you get to review are of very disparate levels. Some end up in calculating one figure per research question, without any attempt at deriving trends or patterns, others do not include any plots at all,... The thing is that the peer review criteria do not really provide a good basis to ensure that learners did indeed assimilate the course contents. Most of the questions in the peer review assignment have a lot more to do with following a canvas and not so much with the course substance itself.For instance, some of the peer review criteria have to do with the narratives for computed statistics and plots. The criteria are: Is each plot/R outout followed by a narrative, Does the narrative correctly interpret the plots, or statistics, Does the narrative address the research question. But when the research question is a question of the type What it the IQR for income per state, for instance, the narrative can be very short: IQR per state shows that the state with higher variability of income is.... So, the narrative meets the 3 evaluation criteria: there is a narrative, it does address the research question, and it does correctly interpret the statistics. But it is not particularly useful.I do understand that Internet-based peer review is challenging, and that you have to settle for neutral criteria that are easy to assess by learners. But the peer review grading grid as it currently stands is not that helpful in assessing whether the course contents has been assimilated.To conclude, when I took the course, my initial plan was to follow the entire specialization. But after having completed the first course of the specialization, I have radically changed my mind, and will look for alternatives elsewhere to get the knowledge/skillset that I am after.",0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"Hi, I am an IT specialist (30 years experience). I undertook the course so I could learn about IBM Bluemix and IoT development, and extend my skills/understanding of the environment. However, I have very little good to say about this course offering. I had numerous issues with what was offered:The videos were generally ok, but some had poor audio. There was minimal video (compared to any other course I have done), and more detail and discussion in videos would have been more helpful.Some of the video material is out of date already, as I suspect Bluemix layout has changed - this made navigation a bit confusing.The downloadable Pi image has changed since the course was prepared, and the newer image has different code as standard. I ended up having to muddle-through manually loading packages and dependencies, etc. to get things to work.I lost many hours trying to debug and rework assignment code, just to get it to work for the grader tool. This was further complicated by not having good debug output from the grader to work with. Naturally some of the grader fails were my own fault, but the majority of issues I ran in to could have been avoided by better worded assignments and/or more detail about requirements.Lastly, it was taking sometimes days to get any response to requests for guidance on the forums / discussions. In fact, I think the majority of useful assistance came from other students who had run in to the same issue(s). When you have a course that is such a short time frame, you really need to be providing assistance in a timely manner.I could not, in any good faith, recommend anyone take this course in the future - which is a little saddening. I do thank the lecturers for their efforts thus far, and sincerely hope they can either improve or drop this course offering in the future.",1.0,1,1,1,1,1.0,0,0,1
"Positive: It was refreshing to see this offering in Coursera. It is an important topic and there is limited amount of offerings (the Wharton course in accounting analytics crosses in the benfords law topic). The discussions in Madoff, Snowden, etc are positive to stimulate critical thinking. The approach was solid. The videos with real fraudsters were very good allowing to connect the theory to practice. The final exam with 60 questions is also very positive to force/stimulate the student to cement the knowledge gained.Negative: This course was shockingly short. If discounted the weekly videos with real examples of frauds, per week there was only about 20-30 minutes of real materials. This is not nearly enough a balanced output of resources to allow students to grasp the concepts. Institutions like Wharton, U. Michigan, U. Illinois, U. Virginia and Yale are packaging in their top courses/specializations at least 1.5 to 3 hours per module (what can have between 4 and 11 modules), plus resources - slides, readings, excel spreadsheets and others. This is an enormous gap. Also - although it was positive to see the materials of the collegue and acfe sites, more was expected. For example, it would be extremely valuable to have resources related to Bernie Madoff, Armstrong, Edward Snowden to engage on a more dynamic discussion. The slides used to back the video lectures should also been made available. Also in some topics more detail was expected. For example, Benfords Law. It should been shown the formula used, what is the threshold value to raise suspicion that manipulation might be present in the financials and also what are considered to be normal values.Overall it is positive to see your offering but I think it can be improved and add a lot more valuable.I wish you luck.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1,0,0

"This course may be misleading aspiring data analysts and scientists: it may give the false impression that, with the tools learned here, you will be able to analyze your data by yourself. In fact, you would be completely missing on large chapters of statistics and, as a result, you would often end up drawing wrong conclusions and believe you did a great job. For example, what is the point of giving you a single 10-minutes video on how to do regression in Tableau if you dont even know regression (which is AT LEAST a one-term course in graduate school, and only after several other prior basic stats courses)?

Some minimal stats knowledge should be recommended as a pre-requisite for this course, or else you end up doing like those monkeys using a statistical software without really understanding what they are doing and drawing conclusions with blissful ignorance.

"What I liked: Materials have quality and a professional approach. Speakers add value to the discussion. Toolkit is important.What I didnt like: This course, as most of Northwestern courses, is excessively short in video lectures per module. In this course each module had about 20 to 30 minutes of videos per module. That is clearly insufficient. Most courses in Whartons, U. Michigans and Illinois specializations in Coursera, have more video materials per module, than your courses in totality... 1.5 to 3 hours per module in the three institutions mentioned in average per module against about 2 hours of videos on all your course modules combined. That is a serious and very salient gap, that I think you should reflect on. In my opinion, quality MOOCs either singular courses, either specializations have to be very well balanced in content - both in quality and quantity. Your courses have very reasonable quality, but fails completely in quantity. As competition in the online e-learning domain increases at an impressive speed, you should benchmark what I mentioned above and do something about it, or probably after 2/3 runs of your courses, people with churn for more addedd value offerings in the dimensions that I pointed out.Good luck.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1,0,1

While I agree that as an academician, we should respect the great people and great event in history, I think that these details are not so important for beginner of financial markets.To conclude, this course is great and I would recommend this course to those who want to know what the real financial world is like!",0.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

"The videos were ok, reading materials added some value, although about three years have passed since the launch of the original course and the materials are all the same. I expected that something new would be introduced to give it a bit more value. But what is very questionable is the architecture of the quizzes. On one hand it goes way beyond the simplicity of the lenght of the course, assume a mindset that extends well beyond this course, and on the other hand after doing the quizzes some times and observing the considered right and wrong answers, some of them - to say the least, are highly ambiguous and express a personal point of view of the instructor in what is right or wrong (what by itself is not very reasonable), and lack ultimately in objectivity regarding the materials covered. I am not by any means saying that the quizzes are hard or simple, I am saying that they lack objectivity and go beyond the scope of the materials and try to put the student on a state of trying to guess what the instructors opinion is regarding the question at hand. In some cases the best answer chosen is absurd. Highly questionable this approach. Again, I believe that evaluations should be challeging, but these quizzes are a bit esoteric, they lack objectivity.Nonetheless, it is important to say thank you for being present in this platform and having the will to put it together.

"I took onus with a number of ideas/concepts offered, simply because they are either misrepresentative of SM or untrue. First, the the prof who talked about visuals OVERPLAYED the role of visuals online. The Internet began as a text communications vehicle, not a medium to share graphics (etc). The rise of video, images only grew as the technology evolved to allow easy distribution. Words are still key online--are there ANY websites major who do not use words? In fact, for many of the good ones, visuals take a secondary role to the actual written content. Second, the section about joining a community and then faking your way to gaining credibility by posing as a newbie etc--especially by marketers--is highly reviled by many SM communities. As an INFLUENCER who has been approached by many marketers in the past decade to help them understand something (etc) I can tell you, we do suss you out quickly and treat you appropriately. We are not here to provide free consulting to make you feel or look competent or knowledgeable (as we would for real members of a community). I contacted a friend whos an influencer in different communities to me, with what your expert suggested. He, too, was not happy with what was in this unit.

I would have preferred to simply share information via dropbox or some other file sharing method.The peer review process is a great idea, although I think its really tricky to do this in a music/art, because there is so much subjectivity and not much of a rubric.

"The course material is good, and Casey always gives further reads and references.

In some way, the iterative process of coming back to the idea, from document to document, helped to refine the game, but it happened more as something natural.I wished we would have had some sort of checklist to evaluate and apply during the design process the framework.As feedback to the instructor, I think he needs to stop using the ending word right? to finish his sentences. At some point, of the course it became really difficult to follow, right?. right?. right? ... ufff ...Also, I believe he knows a lot, but a bit of preparation and flow in his lectures would be appreciated. Maybe the use of some sort of autoclue, would help.Last, but this could be more for the course editors, the instructor has good slides and material, but usually during the lectures the slides disappear (just in the moment one need to focus his attention in the written material) and the instructor appears in first plane.

"I really like the lectures of this course. But on the other hand this programming assignments are...I am not able to see why using such a complicated main code template is useful to understand the principals of the finite element method. I spend 5 hours for trying to install all the libraries and finding the correct header files of deal.II and this visualization thing which is needed in the write_output.h file). Because otherwise you will not be able to compile the code. This is not the first time I did installation of complicated code in unix and I know by heart this can be cumbersome sometimes.But why doing this for a simple programming assignment. I started this course because I want to learn about finite element method and not how to install deal.II software.

Now you have to go back and re-do your homework assignment after you learned what was really expected from the student. This wouldnt be an issue except that your second draft may not get graded if all of the students are done grading.

"Content wise and pedagogically I found this course extremely valuable. It gives you a nuanced insight into federalism and decentralisation. Particularly valuable are 1. The conscious incorporation of a multi-disciplinary perspective that shows that the actual practice of these political architectures are by no means shaped primarily by their institutional design, but heavily influenced by historical, political, social, economic and cultural factors. 2. The extensive references to the three major cases in Africa, particularly through the reading. Very interesting articles also that draw attention to in-country variations and how recentralisation may occur within federal and decentralised systems. Pedagogically the course is also well set up. Jan Erks is an excellent presenter whose tone of voice, articulation and body language make for effective communication. What on the surface seems to be periodic repetition of key points, in fact is intentionally designed so as to get key messages reinforced. There were only three weaknesses in the course when I did it: 1. The English transcripts should have been checked. They may have been done by volunteers whose input is admirable, but often there are grammatical errors or it was obvious that the transcriber didnt understand/capture what Jan Erks was saying. 2. Four out of the readings, which like the others should have been accessible, actually were not - only if you paid for them, which is not what it should have been. 3. This course now seems to be running on automatic pilot: there was no indication whatsoever that there was anyone making up a support person or support team who was monitoring the discussion forum, where the problem of the inaccessible readings was flagged up in week 2 already.

"Overall, this course has very solid content. In fact, this is one of the few (probably the only one) advanced mathematics course on Coursera. More specifically, in order to take this course, you need to have good understanding of group, field and ring. In other words, you are assumed to have taken general undergraduate level abstract algebra courses before.However, there are some aspects of the course that are worth improving. First, probably due to the nature of online course, I personally find learning Galois Theory online very challenging. The lectures themselves make sense. The practice problems and quiz, however, sometimes do not seem to be reinforcing the lectures. The materials on tensor product seem to be unrelated as well. Usually these are covered in a course on commutative algebra. In addition, there was almost none communication within the discussion forums.Overall, I would definitely recommend this course if you have good background in general abstract algebra. After all, Galois Theory has long been a capstone type of course. If you have some background but not solid, it is definitely still doable.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"This is a pretty good course for learning basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I already had some experience with these three languages, so consider that when reading this review. I found that the amount of information they cram into this three week course was pretty substantial, which I think is a positive aspect of the course. They dont just teach you what you need to complete the exercises, they teach you a lot of things that even more experienced users of this language may have forgotten. That being said, I dont think the amount of information covered is realistically anyone could retain in three weeks. I would instead see this course as a crash course as to what features are available with these three languages, then save the course slides as sort of a reference for when you go off on your own. My favorite part of this course is that the exercises are unique and fun. The HTML assignment is sort of boring, but thats because HTML is boring, but the exercises that use javascript are a lot of fun.

"Taking the Learning How to Learn class was one of the best decisions Ive made in the past ten years regarding maintaining my skills current and relevant to my professional life in high tech. I used to fall prey to a sense of being perennially behind regarding the amount of technical knowledge I need to master for my work.

I can use them proficiently to learn smarter, retain information better, and foremost, understand what my particular cues are if procrastination gets in my way again.

"One thing I regret from this course is the content of the video lectures. Having watch the first weeks videos, I found that the professor mostly just read the slides - and did it in a very faithful and careful manner, not to miss a subscript .... This is quite devastating for me. I can read the slides myself (although I have to download it first, since the fonts on the screen are very small). What I need is the professor to explain the logic behind the formulas, the *why* behind what is written, instead of just reading *what* is written on the slides.I find it amusing that with an expected learning of 8 hours a week, the total duration of the first weeks videos add up to a mere 36 minutes. A couple of weeks ago I have just finished a course that subjectively is comparable in its difficulty level. That course is also rich in mathematical content and also requires a commitment of 4-8 hours per week. Each week, the duration of the lecture videos amount to somewhere between 120-150 minutes - and the lecturer didnt read slides; instead, he would explain the logic behind the concepts and provided papers for learners to read on our own time.

"I would give 4.5 stars if I could. First, the positives: I got a great overview of many machine learning topics and learned a lot in general, the professor is excellent, and the programming assignments have plenty of resources to expand your knowledge beyond the core requirements. However, in later weeks, as the assignments grew more complex, I became a monkey. In the earlier weeks there was a focus on the fundamentals, which while very frustrating, are necessary to cement your skills. Later weeks failed to keep this up and emphasized increasingly isolated problems where it wasnt necessary to understand the big picture, and you can succeed (still with frustration) using blind guessing and transposing matrices. The problem with this method is that real life does not always have an assured solution. That said, if you are self motivated, there are plenty of resources to address this gap, and if you want to learn machine learning for its own sake (and not just to get a certificate), I strongly recommend you take this course.",0.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0
"I first took this course when I was at the height of my frustration over learning Nihongo in Osaka. During that time, I had been studying almost everyday for 11 months. I was constantly reading, reviewing, and answering exercises. I often studied until I was too tired to study any more, and yet I could retain the information only for a while. The way I was studying wasnt working for me, and I wanted to know how I can study and learn more effectively. A month after I started taking this course and applying some of the techniques presented in it, I noticed that I was able to remember more of my Nihongo lessons. I actually spent less time studying, but I think that, with the techniques I was using, I was studying in a smarter, more effective, and more efficient way...

In one type, the professor is in a lab or kitchen or classroom or something and is physically demonstrating things. These videos are useful and mostly understandable.

"All in all a great and challenging course. A big thank you to all the teachers! I especially liked the assignments as completing them forced me to think about all the little details and edge cases.A few observations/constructive criticisms:- While the first 3 weeks had almost everything explained rigorously, including complete, usable pseudo codes, the last 2 weeks had lots of holes in terms of details. I think it is down to the fact that it covered a lot, however, pseudo codes suddenly became very high level, to the point where a 5 liner translated to ~100 lines of real code. This in terms meant that learners had to do quite a bit of additional research about the nitty-gritty. Nevertheless I thoroughly enjoyed this extra research, just be mindful about the extra time required.- There are languages with first class support, namely C++, Java and Python3, which means there are starter files supplied. If you choose a different, supported language then be prepared that you have to implement everything from scratch, which again mean extra time, although I would argue that you will learn more, especially in the last 2 weeks.- Forums seemed to be more active in the past, especially with regards to teacher contribution. Be prepared to be self-reliant and able to come up with answers to your own questions.",1.0,0,1,0,0,1.0,0,0,0

Some problem statements are ambiguous and not very clear unless you read more than one time or take a closer look at the examples. Often, the input format/arguments are designed to take redundant info. Some problem even has more than one possible correct outputs, which is just confusing for learning purpose.In terms of lecture videos, its good that there are some classic algorithm problems being demonstrated in the video, however the linkage between how to express a problem in mathematical languages is poorly explained. For example, in the lecture of edit distance, the realization of the matrix was not well explained at all. I personally appreciate a lot of the thorough proving steps introduced in the lectures, however I personally think the proofs are often not well explained to the audience (I also understand that its more difficult to explain proving steps). Considering the large variety of audience, I would recommend the instructors separate the comprehensive more in-depth knowledge into optional videos, in this way the audiences could decide if they want to spend time in optional videos or not based on their own needs, meanwhile the instructors could spend a little bit more time to explain the difficult concepts better.

"There is some good material in this course. The text is fairly good. But I have two main reservations about the course. The first is that the lectures do not always correspond closely enough with the quizzes, and with the text. There are times when one can take a quiz and think, How exactly does this relate to the lectures I just saw? The text has quite a few exercises, but there is a tendency to throw in one or two problems whose difficulty is an order of magnitude above everything else in that section, and I find this discouraging and a waste of time. Save those for a later course, or put them into a separate Extra Challenges section. Learning calculus is hard enough without trying to grapple without some really tricky trig problem at the same time. as a single example.The second reservation is with the instructors manner. Many students find it very enjoyable. I am not one of them. Much of the time, hes OK, especially when the camera is not pointed at him. But as the course progresses, much of the footage is of him at his desk, and the closeups become more and more extreme, the hand-waving and fist-clenching approach sheer windmilling, and the exaggerated eye-rolling, grinning and so forth become so distracting that I cant bear to watch. I realize that the goal was to avoid being a dry-as-dust droning professor, and that is commendable, but there is a happy middle ground between that and hamming. I can almost speculate that there was an impulse to add in cartoon sproing-bonk-cuckoo-klaxon sound effects. (There is actually one such sound effect, but just one, so I wont quibble on that.)I would have found the class more effective with a demeanor that was enthusiastic without being histrionic. Im sure this is one of those you either love it or hate it things, and I may be in the minority.The instructor is not generally one to throw out some concept that has not already been learned and then just motor on without explanation. He errs on the side of overly-detailed explanation, which to me is preferable to skipping over subjects or techniques and assuming you know them.Having said all of this, I repeat that there is good material, and you can learn the fundamentals of calculus for free in this course.",1.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

"Majoring in Genetics and Molecular Biology, I were fortunate enough to meet one of my lecturer who works primarily on Next Generation Sequencing and its downstream analysis. Knowing the importance of how computer science will be in the near future and its power, he urges us to learn about programming and suggests us to extend our semester to take some programming courses from my university. It was the first time I heard about those words: Linux, big data, programming languages such as Java, Python et cetera.I started searching about some summer courses in my university and also other part time courses from other universities in my countries, but none of them is satisfactory. And then I found coursera, and decided to register for this course - Programming for Everybody. It is really a great solution, I dont have to extend my semester, I can learn something so useful to my major yet it is not included in my own course program, and most importantly, I can learn whenever I am free and proceed in my own pace. In this way I find it easier to figure out things which I am confused of and clear them out before I think I am ready for the next.Dr. Chuck is indeed one of the most inspiring and encouraging lecturer I have ever met. Clear explanation, and step by step guidance, he clears all doubts in an interesting way. It is his humour that helps me to remember things. Programming can be boring and dull, it is so technical, imagine that you have to follow a certain number of rules to talk to someone, but Dr. Chuck makes sense out of it (I still remember the first lecture: while you think you are joking with python, it says syntax error).As my first programming course, I really learn a lot from Dr. Chuck, a lot more than I expected to.

Youll probably encounter most of these techniques in the real life of a developer. The course is centered on practicing and the pace is fast. Dont be mislead by the colloquial tone and the quality humor present in lectures. Although the humor is good, youll need to replicate most of the code examples on your machine, if you want to feel youve really learned something at the end of the day. That being said, the course is not perfect: the AJAX part might deserve more room in the future versions of this course.

"While this course seems to have potential, there are many aspects of it that dont result in a great learning experience. The course resources comprise of videos and notes. The videos are informative but the notes are fairly lacking. Perhaps the biggest issue that I found with this course was the disconnect between the material covered in the videos and that which was tested on the quizzes. Often times the quiz questions were either painfully easy or worded in such a way that was not verifiable in any of the class resources. As a result, confusion occurred sometimes more often than true learning. A topic such as missing data is naturally very complex and I wouldnt expect a short course on Coursera to be able to adequately cover it.

"The fact that test cases are not available is extremely frustrating and time consuming. I absolutely disagree with the instructors about the reason why test cases are hidden.Michael LevinHi,Learning new complex things is time consuming, it is essential, and it is ok. Without this time spent you wouldnt have learned even half of what youve learned while trying to find your mistakes yourself. Also, the testing techniques presented here are indispensable in the real life, and many learners of the Algorithmic Toolbox course have already confirmed thisHello Mr. Levin,First please forgive me for communicating with you in this place. I am not sure if there is a direct way to answer you, but I believe you will have access to my response.I entirely agree with what you said that this needs time and I do not mind spending time learning new things. That is why I am here in the first place. But I think that hiding the test sets misplaces the balance where this time is being spend.Let me give you an example: week 3 – hash chains - assignment no. 2. I wrote the app, submitted this and it failed on test no. 5. Having generated tons of test cases I was nowhere closer as all looked good, but still failed your engine. As it turned out the problem was not with the algorithm implemented but with the presentation layer. ‘Check x’ command when x is not found in the hash table should return blank line and my program returned nothing. I could not find this in the specification hence lots of hours trying to figure out the solution.It was not a bug with the program, it was the problem how the data is presented. I do not mind spending time developing solutions to the assignments. I would love if there were more advanced (even optional) problems to solve but I want to spend this time on the algorithm and solving the task rather than trying to figure out how to display the data.Please, do not get me wrong, I absolutely adore the course, lectures are brilliant and my opinion should be regarded as a constructive criticism even if you do not agree with me.

"This course is terrible for many reasons. Firstly, the amount of content is ridiculously small - only about 20 minutes of video lectures per week.

The assignment itself is just opening and saving file in Tableau.2) in weeks 4 peer graded assignment you just asked to write some vaguely defined 1 page description.

"Great hands on exercises and very clearly explained material. Was a bit slow for me I had to watch it at 2x: perhaps the simplest maths should be factored out into a separate mini course and assume a certain background for this one. The course is rather broad, though I was surprised not to hear once about Bayes or Markov (n-grams, HMM etc.). It might be a good idea to create a specialisation consisting of a separate basic maths part, all the methods presented here, methods applicable to bioinformatics and NLP too. And to top it all of Computer Vision. I assume the by-pixel techniques used in this course were just illustrating the points, as I would expect Gabor wavelets or something to reduce dimensionality and save ourselves from sliding windows (and rotations as a bonus). I am not sure if in this specialisation I would have liked to have all science points (how to run an experiment analyse results) separate from how to implement an algorithm and why the algorithm works or mixed in as this course does. I think either works. Some navigational infrastructure on coursera would be awesome (wiki style opportunities to jump around between aspects etc.). Finally, some summary notes would be very useful. When I do decide to implement any of this I will have to look through the exercise pdfs which are a bit long and at my code - perhaps, at the end, when you know someone has completed the exercises.

I am a working professional in the field of data analytics where in Tableau is one of the application we use it on a daily basis. My motive for taking this course is to learn some more innovative techniques that are used by professionals in tableau but the fact was there is nothing new for me to learn here in terms of techniques. I would say this course suits best for a beginner but not for someone who already has some lineage with tableau.Pros:1. Hourglass model is one of the things I liked the most.2. Final project submission is really challenging and which help me to learn lot of new things.Cons:1. Weekly tests are very lengthy2. Every once can get 100% not a big deal by trial and error3. Most of the questions in the weekly course are very subjective and cannot have a single correct answer. We had to retake the test again and again to get 100% due to subjective questionsHowever this course has definitely changed my way of looking into data and the way we decipher it.

"On the positive side I emphasise the importance of bringing this topic to a Coursera course. Also the readings were important and added value to the learning experience.On the other hand there are - in my opinion some aspects that made this course a not so rich experience. First, there are some audio issues in the videos. Second, the quizzes are excessively easy and the in video quizzes should not appear in the weekly assignments. If there are required readings, some of the quiz questions should relate to those readings. This way students had an incentive to go over those readings. But the most salient thing that made my experience very limited was the fact that one of the instructors - the one that presented most of the videos, was excessively nervous and all that he did was read the slides, in most cases not doing so naturally and committing errors, rephrasing, stopping, changing speed. I found it very, very difficult to follow along what he was saying. I had to focus only on the slides, otherwise I would get distracted. I think it is ok to be nervous or at ease, but the team should alerted him to this, and shoot the videos again and again until they had acceptable and balanced quality.A minor thing, I would like to had available the weekly slides to further reflection. I think the video issues that Ive mentioned should been carefully planned before this course made it mainstream.This is my opinion.

"Excellent intro course, but not without issues.In general, pros include reasonable length lectures, provided by _the_ leading expert in the field, and designer of the Scala language. Focus on functional programming techniques versus syntax nuance is a significant benefit - Scala is easy to get bogged down in. Pros also include the fact that lectures have had at least some amount of post-production work done, and manage to make voiceover/slides/whiteboard consistent and coherent better than most similar online classes/tutorials.The assignments are reasonable, and the time estimates of ~3 hrs each was about right on the average, at least in my case (senior programmer with deep background in C/C++, and just enough Java to be dangerous and dislike boilerplate).Some drawbacks - there was no clear segue from basic syntax to collections framework. Thats _IMPORTANT_. In 20/20 hindsight, I would have benefitted from a big, bold slide before the first mention of foreach that said stop here, go to the text, and skim the chapters on collections for foreach and other common operations. This is a building block for everything to follow, and NOT unique to just lists.The major factor keeping this from being a 5 in my mind were that the assignments didnt always make sense as written, and I had to go back and forth between the assignment writeup, the source code and the test cases to really sort out what was required. The assignments could become _much_ more effective if they were provided with more test cases, including expected FAILURE cases and not just bare minimal acceptance cases.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

"I loved this course.I followed this course to prepare myself for teaching a similar course at the HZ University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands.This MOOC suits me perfectly to flip the classroom. Students study the videos offered by professor Page before they come to class. In class, I organize workshops that take about three hours during which the models are discussed and applied in groups of up to four students. Having a big classroom available with whiteboards all around the walls is a big plus. Standing really makes peoples mind moving.At the end of each workshop, students have to do an assignment that closely relates to the topics that arose during the workshop. Together, all these assignments make up the portfolio wherein students keep track of their learning process and reflect on their learning experience.I wish everybody a happy thoughtful day,Frank PeetersSenior Lecturer at the HZ University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlandsfrank.peeters@hz.nl",0.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

The lectures by Prof Andrew Ng were clear and the follow up programming exercises helped reinforce and enhance the concepts covered in the lectures.The entire course was very well organized - videos, notes, discussion groups, suggestions and tips by the mentors was very easy to follow.The focus of this course is on the practical application of machine learning techniques (supervised learning mostly but also some non supervised learning). Prof Andrew tries not to get into the advanced mathematical concepts but instead provides good intuition and then shows one how to apply the different ideas underpinning machine learning with some practical examples. In my view, this is an excellent way to quickly become familiar the concepts and to see machine learning in action. A student of the course will gain very good insights and can then follow up with the underlying math as needed.The final two lectures on how to scale machine learning to large systems and a suggested systematic framework for figuring out which aspects of the design to focus on were very instructive.In summary, i would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in the area of machine learning.

I very much enjoyed the information contained in the course - however I did find that it was difficult to apply some of the very nuanced biases to the financial problems posed in the quiz when many of the biases were used in examples outside of the stock market in the course readings leading up to the quiz. I really wish there were more examples for each bias (and more from the world of finance) because some biases were really hard to distinguish from one another. On one hand I did like that I wasnt spoon fed the information for the quizes but on the other I dont feel as though I was fully equipped to answer some of the quiz questions due to the way the information had been presented.The information built on itself so I found myself going back to week 1 information and week 2 information in week three.,1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"I have taken many courses on Coursera now, and Ive enjoyed and learned a lot from most of them, but I have to admit I was disappointed with this one, despite having a deep interest in modern art and art theory. Here are some of my criticisms:1. The course is aimed at teachers and art educators, which was not made at all clear on the course info page, apart from a single reference to the pedagogical framework. If Id understood this, I may well not have enrolled.2. I found the course very basic, with no consideration of art theory beyond a level appropriate for classroom discussion. This is in contrast to many other Coursera courses, which have been pitched at graduate level or above. I dont really feel like I learned anything on this course.3. The video lectures are very short and uninformative, but the weekly reading list is very long and much more time consuming that the actual tuition. I would have preferred a better balance between tutorials and reading.4. The weekly quizzes were very short (six questions, where other courses typically have 20 to 30 questions per module), and and questions focus almost entirely on the pedagogical set texts, with very little attention paid to the art history or the works discussed in the tutorials. If you are not going to be tested on the material, what is the point of all that required reading?5. The final peer-assessed assignment is lacking in instructions or guidance. For example, you are required to upload images of 3 or 4 artworks and discuss them. It is in fact impossible to upload more than a single image, but there are no instructions on what to do about this. People found various workarounds - uploading pdfs or Word documents, or zipped folders of images, but really, there should be some official guidance on this.6. Comments made when assessing other students work are not anonymous - this is unique in my Coursera experience, where anonymous marking is the norm, and knowing how fractious people can get when they are disappointed with their grade, I am not at all happy about having my name made available to them.Overall, the only reason I persisted with this course is that I wanted to get a certificate with MoMA written on it.

"Firstly i think for a coursera course it is not Long enough at all. There are not enough assignments which motivate studying and fixing the newly learned things in the memory. There are neither required nor recommended readings at all. For me reading is a very good Addition to the Videos so that you can slowly think about the thoughts and arguments. Especially in a topic which is undoubtly very controversal in public as in academia like especially the history of Israel and Palestine from the 30s onwards it is important to give different narratives of history to the students. There are no narratives critical to british colonialism at all mentioned, instead of the White paper of 1939. After all the course represents a very one sided an biased narrative which is presented to a global audience of students. Even if a certain narrative is preferred by the teaching scholars, which is completely acceptable and natural, not just in the field of history, it nevertheless is important to cover different narratives fairly and as neutral as possible, which does not happen in this course. When mentioned other narratives are quickly downplayed or denied, and repeatedly dichotomies like the inferior arabs, the ferocity of the arab oposition and so on are mentioned or cited without beeing problematized at all. Nevertheless the Course was a reminder of many Things I learned before, and brings up some interesting historic connections and key points.",0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1
"First off, I think the course content is amazing! I really like that the instructor used Matlab that encourages the user to create vectorized solutions to the problems. I have heard many negative comments regarding the lack of use of Python, R, or some other library like Cafe or TensorFlow, but I believe all of that should follow after having the mathematical background to understand these principles. The content is not easy, and requires a fair bit of mathematical sophistication, but not so much to lose me, and hard enough to keep me engaged. I really enjoy how each learning unit builds off of the previous one, for instance, linear regression become logistic regression which becomes a neural network.That being said, I really think that this course needs to have a fresh coat of paint on it. I believe it was filmed in 2008. I dont think the content really has been revamped since its release. The recordings look like they were filmed on an old web cam, not even as good as a modern iPhone. The slides should have some design work on them. I know it seems petty to stress over the presentation, but I think many people are turning to programs from Udacity that are very flashy, but not as technically rigorous mainly, I feel, just because of the presentation.

"This course is bad!I had come upto week 4. While Chris Impey is knowledgeable and good, the course structure is very poor and leaves a lot to be desired. I would venture to make some suggestions:a. Restrict each video to a max of 7 minutes. More than that makes one sleepy.b. Reduce the number of videos in each module to a max of say 6.c. Instead of having Chris expound it like an audio reading, please include some slides, pictures,tables so that the matter to be learnt becomes self evident and Chris doesnt have to speak so much. A good example is the Coursera The Global Financial Crisis, which I am also doing currently.d. If you feel all the material in this course has to be studied, then to achieve the objectives in (a) and (b) above, divide this course into two parts, Astronomy: Exploring Time and Space - part I & II.e. The written assignments are very simple and do not require any mental resources other than memory. Can you make the questions more challenging? For example, in Telescopes (Assignment 2), can you not ask a question like In addition to Atacama, Chile, using Google earth, which other parts of the globe may be suitable for installation of ground based telescopes? or To obviate the blurring effect of the atmosphere, discuss the possibility of high altitude balloon based telescopes? or What do you feel about the fact that since todays mobile phones have high computing ability, their components can be used to make a low-cost space based interferometric telescopes?Kudos to Chris and his team!

The weeks are very densely packed. In Week 2, I worked 3-4 hours every day, and then was greeted by 11 classes due in 7 days when I opened Week 3. The assignments are rated 10 or 20 minutes but actually take about 2 hours. It would often take me thirty minutes to an hour to get through one 5-15 minute video.

If you are already solidly grounded in music theory and have much of voice leading on autopilot, this class is faster.That said, I would not want him to cut out anything.

"For me, this was the toughest of the first four courses in this specialization (now that the last two are cancelled, these are the only four courses in the specialization). Im satisfied with what I gained in the process of completing these four courses. While Ive forgotten most of the details, especially those in the earlier courses, I now have a clearer picture of the lay of the land and am reasonably confident that I can use some of these concepts in my work. I also recognize that learning of this kind is a life-long process. My plan next is to go through [https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370], which, based on my reading of the first chapter, promises to be an excellent way to review and clarify the concepts taught in these courses.What I liked most about the courses in this specializations are: good use of visualization to explain challenging concepts and use of programming exercises to connect abstract discussions with real-world data. What Id have liked to have more of is exercises that serve as building blocks -- these are short and simple exercises (can be programming or otherwise) that progressively build ones understanding of a concept before tackling real-world data problems. edX does a good job in this respect.My greatest difficulty was in keeping the matrix notations straight. I dont have any linear algebra background beyond some matrix mathematics at the high school level. That hasnt been much of a problem in the earlier three courses, but in this one I really started to feel the need to gain some fluency in linear algebra. [Theres an excellent course on the subject at edX: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1%3AUTAustinX%2BUT.5.05x%2B1T2017/ and Im currently working through it.]Regardless of what various machine learning course mention as prerequisites, I think students would benefit from first developing a strong foundation in programming (in this case Python), calculus, probability, and linear algebra. That doesnt mean one needs to know these subjects at an advanced level (of course, the more the better), but rather that the foundational concepts are absolutely clear.

"The effect of this course in understanding the body physiology and understanding the terminology of other courses can be compared to learning to read. Now I can take other, more specialized courses without having to Google every other word and actually understand the processes theyre talking about instead of simply memorizing them.Especially, now that I am taking several other courses, I have the opportunity to appreciate the depth clever systematic approach to explain such complex processes of our body. Sometimes I got the feeling that I lack some background as many terms used to explain processes were not explained.

Such great interest and inquiry have you wakened in me, thank you very much!I would like to note that the course used a wonderful array of tools to create understanding of the subject. One of the best was storytelling by Dr. Jakoi. Stories in the best way to learn as theoretical information is related to real-life situations, and in fact, I remembered all stories that she told, like stories about her son who had high parasympathetic tone, about guy who drank too much water to remove kidney stone, etc. Along with remembering the stories, I remembered the information it was about.One more thing I would like to note is that I liked your tests and practice quizzes. Not all courses have practice questions after the lessons and it’s excellent way to memorize info. Also, quizzes include tasks of application of knowledge in some practical situations - makes you think and analyze the info to explain real-life phenomena. It’s difficult to correctly reply to such questions only relying on information: you need understanding of the process.

You will find many counter-intuitive ideas (such as highlighting is not as effective as making notes in the margin; exercise and sleep actually help your brain) and useful techniques (such as deliberate practice, interleaving, pomodoro technique to beat procrastination, recalling, spaced repetition etc.) to help your learning.I think school children from 13-14 years upwards of age can grasp much of the course on their own.

The questions with multiple choice work wrong: marking all the right answers is not appropriate, you must choose the all of the above option, but it is wrong because of formal logic. The correct option here is only to match all the answers and the all of the above line. Also many questions are debatable, and there is no answers in the materials for the course. And, finally, the uploading of the last assignment was just impossible for more than a week, and I dont know if it will ever be possible. Bad experience.",1.0,1,0,1,1,0.0,0,0,1

This Course is bad! I try to ask for help and then mentors only reply with I cant help you because of the Honor code. Well tat doesnt sound like much of an honor code to me. Of course I am doing my own work duh! I just need help. Dont we all need help from time to time. I think Coursera needs a lot of improvement. I am extremely dissatisfied with Coursera and this course but especially the mentors and their lack of mentoring. Education should be uplifting and positive and an area where individuals can ask question and receive help and not be scolded for asking help or asking questions like a beat down dog. I mean really I think Coursera needs to go take some hints from a real school or university and seek information on education and how it is best when students teach each other and If I can ask for help and learn from others and give then the opportunity to help me that whats the point of a discussion board. Do away with the discussion board or change the way the honor code is written. Yes I agree with Honor and doing your own work but come on. Help and tutoring is a valuable part of education and necessary to learning! Please make the necessary changes to better Coursera and make it a more positive educational experience. I mean please I am trying the best I can with what I have got and no one seems to want to help me learn and improve on my skills and my understanding. Make changes and make them now.Another reason I hate this course Is that Coursera does not believe in people helping one another. Then the mentors cant even explain how to work through the problem. The menotrs make things more stressful than they need to be because the dont give help or hints or clues. People need to talk to people on the phone or in person or the instructor needs to give better examples so people can better figure things out on their own. I just think Coursera is crap and this has been a very unpleaseant experience for me. Then on the discussing board i see others struggling with the same things and the mentos dont help them. People are pleading for help and not receiving any guidance or direction to help them figure things out. Things need to change with this program. They need to change soon!,1.0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0,0,1
"All of the review Ive read were that the course was great, so maybe it is me that was the problem. However, as I would go through the written material, I would try to work the problems given as examples, and when they did not work, I was confused and wondered why the example given to teach us would not work. I asked for help a number of times, providing screen shots of the results I got trying to duplicate what the example was supposed to show, and page numbers of where the example was presented in the course materials. One former student basically said that I should not be trying to duplicate the examples, but just accept the concept they were trying to show. Another did a good job of explaining one of my questions, but then all replies to my question ceased. I decide to drop out of the class and try teaching myself, as I have done on everything I have learned about computers since my 1st computer in 1983. I have been very impressed with other courses given by Coursera members, but this one was not one of them. All of the other submissions praise the course, so maybe it is just me, but none of the other submissions mentioned any actual things the course had done - just that it was great.",0.0,0,1,0,1,1.0,0,0,1

If no examples have been covered, how can a quiz-taker be expected to create the proper tags?

In that case, I began wondering why I was taking this course, rather than just reviewing the many free html5 explanations on the Internet.Further the very general response to the submitted page of html gives me no help when I am simply told something isnt right and I should review the lessons--again.

"Cant say I am in any way not satisfied with the course, but here are a few personal feelings taking this course: 1. It is basically very straightforward to understand, although some part prof Ng takes extra time to care for some details, which I suspect for some students with solid math/stats foundation will find redundant, but indeed help those who dont a lot. 2. The algorithms introduced in this course are basic but also powerful, and relatively straightforward to understand too. 3. The programming exercises are very carefully designed to help students with the algorithms, while leaving the details of other programming components, which are very very very important to keep students on speed. 4. This course may require a little bit of Object-Oriented Programming language knowledge, and a little bit of calculus and stats to make the studies more smoothly.

"Why is this course dangerous?I took this course because first I liked the idea to have a history lesson spanning the age of the whole universe. Maybe it is also intriguing to explain everything just with one principle: the second law of thermodynamics. BUT as it turned out they dont have any clue what this second law of thermodynamics means. They always forget the second part of it: it is just valide in a closed system. I think everbody will agree, that the earth for example isnt a closed system.In the beginning they tell you you should be critical about everything new you hear or get taught. But if you are critical and question things they teach you they will ignore you. One glance at the discussion forum shows: they are fast in answering good feedback and compliments by students, but critical questions (with scientific papers who show different facts) get ignored for weeks and months. They are cherry picking. They just see what encourages their view and their opinion and ignore everything that contradicts their course, opinion, believe and dogma. In this respect they are so dangerous. That is the same principle how cults work.Maybe their goal, stopping polluting and changing the world in such a speed seems to be a good one. But also here you have to be careful. When they talk about climate change and the overuse of ressources they are exaggerating by a factor of 50! In my opinion you are damaging an important discussion if you are lying and exaggerating in such a shameless way. For sure it is not helpful! But again, the truth doesnt fit in their world view.Furthermore they teach that cities get blown away by taifoons is caused by the universe balancing entropy. This isnt just lack of understanding physics, or history, or flow mechanics, it is just insane.In summary: this is not a history course, but the teachings of a lying, exaggerating, cherry picking cult with no knowledge in particle physics, cosmology, chemistry, biology or even history.So please: if you take this course, be aware of this pitfalls and their intentions.",0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1
"This is an excellent introduction to ML.

I guess those who want to understand the math behind the techniques can always look elsewhere, but Professor Ng obviously knows a great deal and is able to clearly and concisely explain difficult subjects, and so I was a bit disappointed to not be getting his instruction in the more difficult aspects.But, overall this course is great.

I know I am not explaining myself well; I simply mean that to learn a language in which the alphabet is different and the meanings are based on emphasis rather than actual words, requires, I think, perhaps a bit more anchoring for the complete novice. For example, i wish we could have learned some simple conversational phrases, early on, just to get started, without worrying right away about all the sounds.

I understand that the last assignment was aimed mostly at forcing students to view all the lectures or get familiar with the provided code, but doing something bigger for the assignment (or at least without such obvious hints) would be a nice challenge and bring more value to the certificate, I think.Splitting week 4 into two with separate assignments is also worth considering, as there was a lot of material covered in the last week, in my opinion (but I may be biased, as I went through the last week in a hurry, because I was late with my assignment).",1.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,1,1,0

While those things may be easy to explain without the math they are very difficult concepts to implement and a simple 10 minute video wont clear the fog.You absolutely will not master data analysis with this course. Ive used Excel for over 15 years, daily, and to have the gall to say your course will master something with a few videos is misleading and deceptive.If it wasnt for the TA/Mentors who do the lions share of work in the forums answering questions and deciphering the questions so students can understand them this course would be an abysmal failure.If youre wanting to jump on the data analysis/ scientist bandwagon look elsewhere. i.e. EdX has a great course on a true introduction to data analysis that is more in line with peoples impression of actually using excel in that context.Now, having bashed the course I do believe the instructor to be a very competent and knowledgeable individual, but I feel hes been in academia too long and has grown accustomed to teaching those whove been in school continuously and still have algebra/ stats fresh in their minds vs. those who need to brush away the cobwebs. The course in more on the level of a 201 and in certain parts 401 level but not 101.",0.0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1,1,1
"ok, im probably not the average student here cause i am old,... saying that i have a fine art qualification and 25 years of almost there design experience to have a point of view. almost being the important part of it...what this module gives you is a very firm understanding of how design works these days. the main lecturer is really good at what he does, and thats probably the most important part of any teacher-student situation. For personal reasons i committed a bit too much on this course, and i am glad to say that whether you feel like devoting 8 hours a week for it or 28 as i did, there is stuff for you to learn.although i already knew pretty much 70% of the material, having the concepts reestablished by this teacher in such structured manner really helped me out.If were to get sentimental, i can honestly say that i feel this module was the best thing i did this past month, cause through fine art i have been designing for the past 25 years, but this gave me the STRUCTURE to think of DESIGN in relevant terms.awesome.-do it!btw.,ive tried to be as honest as i can possibly be here, hope it helps. if it was crap i would say its crap. but this one isnt. and of course its up to you to fully exploit this wonderful possibility.",0.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

There were many errata that really should have been fixed in the beta iterations of this course.Thirdly, I really would like to see more application and less discussion of implementing algorithms.Fourthly, the scaling section was also a major disappointment. While it is mildly interesting to learn about stochastic gradient descent, I think it would have been more interesting to have a discussion about how classifiers work in a parallelized computing environment or actually to try one out using Spark.Finally, given that GraphLab/Dato/Turi was just acquired by Apple, I question whether it is worthwhile to take this course as ALL the materials are taught using a library that in all likelihood will cease to exist.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"This course in Machine Learing was challenging, but do-able... and very rewarding. This is the first on-line course Ive taken. It has been many years since my last formal college course, so I was a little rusty at the math (Im 55 yrs old, ancient compared to my peers in this class. My last math class was over 3 decades ago, probably before most of my classmates were born. Damn, Im old). Even so, with Mr. Ngs teaching style, I was able to finish the course with both a good grade and - better still - a good grasp on the subject material. I will certainly continue to pursue additional learning in this area.Machine Learning is a fascinating field. I was interested in this area way back in the late 80s when I first heard the term Neural Network, but there were no on-line courses in that pre-internet era, so the availability of information about the subject was very limited. It was mainly in breathless magazine articles about the coming AI revolution. It took a few decades for that promising spark to mature into a practical reality. Now, with the appearance of Coursera and other on-line education portals, much of this information is readily available to all with the curiosity and perseverance to learn about it.I am grateful for this opportunity to learn about Machine Learning!",0.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

This should be THE teaching model for programming in any language!Thank you, Dr. Chuck! And I look forward to learning more from you in our follow-up courses!",0.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

"There is a lot of good information in here that is told poorly. Professor simply reads the slides to you for the most part, foregoing practical examples in favor of sticking to abstract concepts, and letting you figure out the details. Quizzes had errors in them that made passing them unnecessarily difficult. The slides that you could download are sometimes cutoff, leaving information out. This is very indicative of the classes I had in college, where the class was here are a bunch of whitepapers/books, read them, and youll be an expert. There is little in the way of helping you understand these complicated concepts, and because they are complicated, many argue that should absolve the professor from needing to find a way to teach them in an understandable way (when other professors have been able to take complicated topics like this and distill it down to something that was both fun to learn and gave a solid foundation for going forward).

"This course is very strong with respect to presenting the concepts you need to know for data science. It is extremely WEAK in terms explaining those concepts. If you are like me and did this kind of math back in the 70s and 80s but have not used it since, be prepared to seek sources outside Coursera in order to understand the material and pass the quizzes. The instructors leave out explanations and skip important points leaving you confused about the concept.Example: In the Permutations and Combinations sections, results of calculations are thrown at you with no explanation of how the instructor got the answer. 10 minutes later, totally as an aside, you get the explanation. The course is not taught in such a way that A leads to B, B leads to C, and C leads.....; instead the instructor will tell you about C, might explain A, and forget about mentioning B until the graded quiz. That is why you will need to fill in the gaps using websites like betterexplained.com or kahnacademy.com.The student is better served by looking at the syllabus and then going to either of those sites - where the explanations are worth your time.In addition to failing to present steps in a logical order, the course often teaches at an extremely basic level but tests at a much, much higher level. Again, to get to the higher level of understanding needed to pass ANY of the required, graded quizzes, the student will need to heavily utilize outside sources. The explanations on the practice quizzes also fail in many cases to thoroughly explain why an answer is correct.Then there are the issues with Coursera itself, the course navigation using Chrome is quite bad. If I did not constantly monitor what part of a course I should be in versus what part of the course automatically loaded next, I often found myself taking a quiz for which no lectures had been presented. The TAs response to my complaint was flippant and WRONG. She then closed my question and I could not respond or ask for more details.If I had it to do over again I would invest my time and money somewhere else. In my opinion, Coursera should rescind the instructors rights to charge for this course until the instructors improve and meet higher teaching standards.",1.0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0,0,1

There is so much detail and explanation about the statistics and concepts behind how it works, but there is hardly ever an actual lesson on the code used or needed to implement the algorithms. When trying to fumble my way through the code, I found, on several occasions, the code in the self-directed lessons to be incomplete (Im referring to pieces of code that were obviously meant to be there, but were missing), causing hours and hours of anguish and turmoil. I feel like there should be a lot more time spent on the actual coding and learning how to implement it within the code (similar to the 1st course), rather than spending an exuberant amount of time going through derivations and no time on actual coding and how to implement it within the programming language.If you are a software designer/engineer or programmer, then you should be fine as long as you pay attention to the very long lessons and derivations and can fix the broken code that you are given. There are other mistakes within the quizzes as well, which make them near impossible to pass. For example, it is unclear which model you need to use to calculate in order to get the correct square foot.

Also, suggest to reduce discussions centred to challenges (the course has taken too much of time) and more towards different new services adopted by different cities to capture benefits/impact to the city GDP.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

"As other reviewers have noted, this course is NOT for beginning programmers! (Unless maybe you are a mathematical genius with total recall.)I have a little background in programming, HTML and CSS, but I found this course to be an absolute nightmare. It would be interesting to find out if any of the rave reviews came from real beginners.Most of the problems have already been noted by other reviews, so I will only mention a few that I did not see mentioned.The course requirements should include hardware and software essentials. In particular, the student has no choice but to use Android Studio. If their system is not running a 64bit OS at 2.4 GHz with at least 8 GB of RAM, it can literally take DAYS for Studio to complete the build so that the student can do anything with assignment code.There is a desperate need for a glossary. The course dives in with more acronyms than the military, and assumes the attmpting learner already has a handle on APIs, SDKs, etc., not to mention many other technical terms (interfaces, ...). If I asked the average programmer to evaluate the MT based on comparisons with the Complutensian Polyglot and Codex Alexandricus, the effect would probably be about the same.Another glaring omission for beginners is a battery of exercises for each concept/skill.As for Weve organized all these topics into units that represent roughly 4-6 hours of work each, that is absurd! If you multiplied that by 10, it would still be a stretch.I have no doubt about the programming and technical competence of the instructors (though there are some errors in a number of the instructions). And Im sure they are very nice people who really want others to learn. The root problem seems to be what professional communicators call The Curse of Knowledge -- a syndrome in which a person is so familiar with their subject that they cannot begin to imagine what it is like for someone who is not.My recommendation to a beginner is to look somewhere else. Take a good introductory course in Java before diving into the vastly more complex world of the Android environment. I am not qualified to evaluate the course from the perspective of an experienced programmer, but I have noted that they are frustrated by clutter caused by token attempts to make this a beginner course.My recommendation to the faculty is to completely re-engineer this whole specialization. They should have a separate set of courses truly designed for beginners, and they should get help from qualified instructional designers who specialize in online adult education. (Might not be a bad idea to get the VU English department to review the lecture text as well.)My recommendation to anyone is to never believe anything Coursera tells you about a course. Audit the course BEFORE you pay any money! This is especially important if the course has not actually started. This course started two months late, and I could not get a refund before the course even got under way!After taking nearly 6 months to wade through a little over half the course requirements, I decided to look at the rest of the assignments and project. This removed all doubt that to continue was a hopeless waste of time. So, I decided to end the nightmare, and Im glad its over!",1.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"Might be good for someone looking for a casual overview?I really wanted to like this course, and was excited about the series. Very disappointing.

Yes, you can use other software, *except for the capstone*, per another reviewer: this is fatal.Presenters just not fully prepared to lecture on the topic: the nail in the coffin was the end of the week 4 lectures on clustering: So, at this point, you really should be able to go out there and build a really cool retrieval system for doing news article retrieval. Or any other really, really, really cool retrieval that I cant think of right now. But of course theres lots of interesting examples.

"In my humble opinion it is necessary to review some points in this module:1) Video Content: Making more dynamic, switch between explanations and slides in full screen. Only explanations, it is very tiring to attend the classes. The video would be ideal as shown in week 4 of this Mooc: How the hotel shouldnt work with Expedia? or video: How to hotel shouldnt work with Booking.com?2) Analysis requested: In the first week the requested analysis was of a very high level, it required knowledge of financial analysis and hotel area. In my case, I felt much difficulty because I do not have any knowledge in the hotel industry. And analyzing the exercise, I realized it was necessary to have knowledge of financial ratios of profitability and a certain familiarity in the hotel industry. I left a comment on the discussion board stating that I was not feeling safe to do the exercise. However, there was no demonstration by the teachers of the course.In short, I was not feeling prepared, let alone analyze colleagues. The first time, did not get the minimum score. The second time, with the longest time, I could better perform the exercise. But rather it was the result of review of financial ratios and other other accessories. I realized that those who examined me in the first and second time, had little or no idea about financial analysis. And another point that struck me was that one of the people who fell for me to analyze, was all in white and the person apologized for failing to do. With nothing to analyze, I did not think fair to give a low rating, so I preferred not to analyze. If the person left blank, something needs to be revised.When mounting a course, you have to take into consideration that there are different levels of students: beginner, intermediate and advanced in the subject matter.The first week was not to have been given is analysis. It could have been the third or fourth week of this Mooc, so it would have time for a further deepening of the matter addressed.3) Amount of content: Adding the video, quiz and analysis, are about 30 content. It is very tiring and little time for such content. Could decrease the amount of video and quiz, relocating to another week course or Mooc.4) Feedback: Teachers need to leave a contact way (facebook, twitter, etc.) and be active in Coursera forum or leave a wizard to ask questions when needed.5) Notes: He missed the weight of the notes. I found a little confusing the allocation of notes.6) Curriculum: Missed curriculum (biography) of teachers. No contact information.7) Books: Missed suggestions of books in the hotel industry.Anyway, these are only observed points in order to contribute to development of course.

"This was the first MOOC I ever signed for and I wasnt disappointed. Far more complex, detailed and demanding than I had expected.... which suited me perfectly.Although brilliantly researched and scripted, Professor Germanos detailed input is spoiled by his unecessarily academic style. I found that his tendency to accumulate endless lists of adjectives had an unfortunate hypnotic effect.I very much like the material presented by Kurtis Schaeffer, especially his contribution on the development of Buddhism in the US. His interviews were well-conducted and his remarks always to the point.Interesting - and again complex material from Clifford Saron who managed to caputre the attention of my rather non-scientific brain. Very well presented material and a pleasure to listen to him.The input from the Tibetan participants was more accessible to non-specialists, straight to the point and very refreshing.The work done by the meditators was brilliant and probably what I had been looking for when I registered for the course. I feel that I now know just enough to pursue the practices on my own. It all feels very new, a little bit scary, quite exhilarating and luminous.Some of the interviews were more interesting than others but they all contributed to broaden the scope of the course.I only give 4/5 to the MOOC because of the poor quality of the subtitles. Not being a native speaker and not used to hear American English, I had to rely on them. They were so bad that, at times, what was written was exactly the contrary to what was being said. Hardly any proper names or foreign words were spelt correctly either.

If there had been a working autograder for the last final project this course would have been worth it somehow.What does that mean?- The lectures provided valuable information.- The quizzes generally made sense (in relation to the lectures).- Learning how to code wasnt really possible.Why is that?- There is only one programming assignment.- The autograder doesnt give any feedback at all why resp. where things go wrong. Thats everything but good style (for software as well as for learning).- Code snippets cant be tested individually.

"Thaddeus is adept at touching on the very basic essentials of the guitar--electric and acoustic. I personally have learned so much from him. Hes smart in his approach, articulate, and makes it so anyone of any skill level can learn how to play. Before, I always believed learning an instrument was such a daunting and insurmountable task, but with this course I find myself wondering why I never decided to take up guitar in the first place! That beings said, there are few caveats I will insert here which will explain why I gave it 4/5 stars: (1) This is an introductory course in its purest form. What do I mean by that? Well, if you have any prior knowledge of the guitar (as I had), you will find the beginning to be very, verrry slow. You will soon discover that you are not as beginner as you initially thought yourself to be. Hence, you will likely be frustrated, almost insulted by the seemingly obvious information being told to you. (2) Peer f*ing reviews: the the bane of my existence. Well, thats not entirely true. To be fair, they can sometimes be very helpful, but come on, to have to sit and evaluate five, fiiiiiiiive peoples homework assignments can take away a pretty sizable portion of your day you didnt necessarily plan on allotting. I suppose it is a necessary evil, but to me its just evil. A dreaded nuisance, in my opinion. (3) This class is metronome-friendly-centric-heavy. Im not a metronome person, myself, and I never will be, even after all the times I felt like I was trying to be converted into one. It works for some, but not me..... In conclusion, please do not allow these thoughts to waver your decision on whether to take the course, but instead just be mindful of them. Take them with a grain of salt. My experience with the course may not be your experience. If you are committed to learning the guitar, this is a fabulous course to take that will, in fact, teach you a great deal of what you need to know.

Youll learn only that in this course, in general.

While interesting, it is probably more useful to leaders and managers, still I learned a lot from these sections, especially in the last week.As for the technical aspects of the course, there is not a single complaint I could make - the course material and tasks were properly made and self-explanatory in most cases, so everything ran smoothly.

"Useful course for exposure to debates that animate the common law, with some bits about the relationship of English and European law, pre-Brexit. Its probably fair to say this course offers some experience in the elusive skill of how to think like a lawyer. The legal debates might seem a bit pedantic to all but the specialist. For example, the course attempts to sketch in the debates about proper use of precedent, with frequent reminders that the task of fully developing such debates is beyond the scope of the course--Ill bet some students were thinking, thank goodness its beyond the scope. Its all clear enough, and delivered pretty much exclusively in traditional lecture format--theres even a lectern. Each of these lessons about the legal debates outlines and develops the opposing sides but doesnt give you a whole lot of new content to be tested. Thus, many of the quiz questions are on comprehending passages from cases, statutes, or commentary. Such quiz questions sometimes feel like those reading comprehension questions from a standardized test, rather than tests of the material covered in the lesson.",0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"The course covers the basic foundations of behavioral finance, especially prospect theory and various cognitive biases that negatively influence our decision making in financial affairs.The topics covered are definitely very interesting and the lecturers frequently prove that they know what they are talking about and explain some topics in adequate depth and breadth.For a valuable Coursera course I am expecting that most of the material is covered with video lectures (otherwise I read a book on that matter) and I am expecting thought-through slides with clear definitions, clear practical examples and exercises, and the presentation of experimental proofs for the given statements.Regrettably, most of this course is comprised of simple slides with limited structuring, as definitions, exercises, and proofs are often intermingled. More importantly, only a very limited subset of the course is covered with the suitable and valuable video lectures.Especially the last of the three-week course consist mostly of reading material from an external website.The exercises after each of the three weeks are at the lower end of what I have seen on Coursera and the lecturers should consider putting more effort in creating useful questions for formative and summative evaluations of the learning progress.In summary, smart lecturers present a very interesting and highly relevant topic, but they put to little effort in creating a compellingly online course.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

There needs to be some warning on how to interpret and manage the files so that you get the same numbers being asked for in the test. Again this too me about 10 hours to resolve.

"My overall experience with this Specialization, in general, and this 1st Course, in particular, is very positive.On the positive side, I really like the fact that the Courses are practice-oriented and provide not only theoretical frameworks, but also insights from experts, practical guidance, and evidence-based best practices.Also, the idea of applying Team-Based Learning (TBL), in the forms of Readiness Assurance Tests (RATs) and scenario-based RAT Application Exercises, for assessing participants learning, is excellent!However, there are a couple of downsides, thats why Im not giving a 5 star positive feedback.The first problem is that not all of the required readings are freely available via the Coursera platform, or elsewhere online. I appreciate the excellent quality of the chosen materials, but, if it becomes compulsory to spend more than US $100 for buying books, then the total cost of this Specialization elevates quite a lot, given that I had to pay €162 for it. On my opinion, there should be at least a note in the description of both the Specialization and the Courses about these requirements, in order to make an informed decision before enrolling.The second downside has to do with Course 1 and Course 2 overlapping materials. Im referring to guest interview videos. Thats mainly a problem of the 2nd Course, as there are almost no guest interviews in this Course, and the one interview provided is already available in Course 1. I understand that the topics discussed apply to the topics of both Courses, but, still, I find it an unnecessary repetition.The last problem is about the dates that the Courses are run. Course 1 runs during a given period, Course 2 is on demand, but it makes sense to attend it before Course 3, that also runs during a given period, which overlaps with the period of the 1st Course. Sorry, this makes it very difficult to attend everything and to seriously focus, as its always about running for deadlines, especially when one has to produce three (3) Board Effectiveness Assessment Reflection (BEAR) papers :( .",1.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

"Thats a great course for those who want to broaden their horizons in mathematics. Learning process involves a huge amount of useful information from different areas, such as linear algebra, fields and rings theory, and many more.But Id like to share some thoughts with possible readers of this review.1) A learner should have a really strong mathematical background. I would say that its a graduate-level course, and I couldnt recognize that from course description. Otherwise,2) One needs a HUGE amount of time to learn all the material thoroughly. Just to clarify, Im changing my job now, so I fortunately have a lot of free time. And I spend almost ALL of one for this course! :) Thats great, Im ready to do that, but how many people have that kind of possibility? Amount of given information is enough for a separate specialization in Coursera terms, so maybe it would be good to split this course into several separate ones.. for sure, it fits into a standard HSE university course. But I can say that I do have some background in maths, but a number of years it was unused, so it takes time to recover a lot of things. Just my thoughts, but I see how discussion in forum is fading away, guess it means that a lot of people start giving up.3) And finally I would suggest to add some small quizzes within lectures as its done, for example, in Learning How To Learn course. In my opinion, it can help learners to catch more from videos.So, 3 weeks left to finish this course, so Im starting a next quiz! Thanks to everyone and happy learning!

I could see asking for money if you went into more detail information regarding each lesson, but just telling me what each term means and then pointing me to a website, then asking for 50 bucks is kind of cheap considering no in-depth information was ever given.2. Why did you have all of those people that are in the field of cybersecurity just read off a list of terms? You could have done that, kind of a waste of time for those other people. I am guessing that you had to pay them. Which would explain why you are asking 50 dollars just to take the quizzes.3. Where was the real life experience?

"While I love Dr. van Lents teaching style, I was somewhat disappointed in the course as a whole. After about the first week the instructor was not heard from again on the forums. It wasnt until about the last week that some official teaching staff started to make an appearance.This was an issue as, especially in the first week, as there was a good deal of discrepancy between what was on the grading rubric, what was provided in description for the homework, and what was in an optional video that described the homework. All with no official direction as to what was correct, or how things should be properly graded. The students were just left to themselves to try and interpret what the instructor meant, and what was the proper thing to do in regards to the peer grading. This continued, albeit to a far lesser extent, through the remainder of the course.While I dont expect instructors to be in the forums all that often, I do expect them to clear up obvious issues, and to make some type of official statement as to how students should proceed. I believe this was the first offering of this course, and I hope as it offered again those discrepancies are fixed, and perhaps more official teaching staff are able to monitor the forums.As far as the material itself, it is pretty good, and covers most of the basics well. As I said at the start, I really love Dr. van Lents teaching style. She is very encouraging, and easy to understand. She is also very human, making mistakes as she goes along, and correcting them.

Code was (very) poorly indented, had inconsistent single vs. double quotes, and didnt follow any style guide out there.

Slides need at least some monospaced font; better would be colored code snippets or screenshots.- The Gulp and Grunt week felt pretty strangely structured. The two task runners just had such long lectures videos that it was a really big hump to get over, especially since we didnt use Grunt later.- (harder to fix) My files got pretty inconsistent with what I needed to copy/download over week-by-week from the course.

"I found this course very much valuable for kids as well as other elder people. The teaching method was highly impressive and Dr. Maya Adam really inspired me. I wanted to give 5 stars but I found few things missing, such as food recipes were without quantity of items (especially in written format), gardening was described in a very short format (I felt that it required little bit more detail), market visits could be a very healthy and informative section, some experts advice & suggestion (including famous chefs), some discussion over food available and prepared in hotels/restaurants & also visits over there. Over all its really a good course and I would definitely recommend to others.

"I give 5 star for the teacher, really approach having such a well-organized teaching material.I also give -1 star for the homework assignment and its (almost) GraphLab only approach. Yes, it mentioned alternative approach (which is much more popular than GraphLab), but there are many bugs & trivial difficulties to get it through. With scikit-learn as a great open source package, the only reason (I suspect) to choose GraphLab is commercial purpose. For me, if the homework assignment is only instructed properly for loading data into Pandas, I can finish each programming assignment within 1 hour for sure using scikit learn; but now, it takes 30 minutes and I still cannot load the data correctly.

"To be honest, I thought the course stumbled and fell short. It was too basic and slow paced. The tone was a bit immature at times, and perhaps appropriate only for a grade school level classroom--not something for working professionals. And its certainly not mature enough or challenging enough for a university class. Even if the goal were to teach those with no programming experience, it could accomplish that while providing more content, and making the content relevant.Is the course worth the price? Hell no. If you do pay, you may feel very cheated at the end. The entire course can be reduced to 3 pages of notes. One would be better off checking into other free, online tutorials.Im not sure about the value of the videos titled Office Hours. They all appeared as self-promotional behavior from the professor, as if to say, hey look how great I am making this video in Paris. Theyre really nothing more than that. In one video, he corners a guest speaker at a conference, who appears annoyed after a few minutes and gives the professor a polite brush-off: other people here would like to talk with me too.

"The best online course Ive taken so far. This is not an exaggeration. Throughout the course, I truly felt the importance of the material taught and their applicability in my daily life. Ive started using the Pomodoro technique (with the help of an app) when tackling projects at work or want to be productive at home (taking an online course, learning some new skills). I also owe it to this class, and this might be a side effect rather than a direct impact, for bringing my brain to a more relaxed mental state. In other words, the topics about focused/diffuse mode and the discussion of thinking patterns provided a much more clear path not only for approaching tasks, but also escaping from that constant loop that eventually leads to a headache. Without going into more details, this is a wonderful class for anyone, anywhere accessible to take. Happy learning!",0.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

"I have a theoretical background in relational algebra and SQL. This course did a great job of actually applying that theory in practice in the form of business situations. By using real life data, it also accurately presented raw data as not perfectly organized or clean. Filtering with subqueries, IN, WHERE, and OUTER JOIN statements are absolutely crucial in cleaning data in real life situations; this course did an excellent job of demonstrating that importance.I have 2 interrelated critiques however: The usage of 2 different platforms (MySQL for the exercises and Teradata for the quizzes) was very confusing given their distinct syntaxes. I think it would have been more powerful to have the exercises and quizzes on the same platform. Furthermore, the Teradata platform was oftentimes overwhelmed by the number of users and frequently crashed. Going forward I would recommend either ensuring that the servers can handle the amount of user-load, or switching over to the MySQL platform entirely.",1.0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0,0,0

The course is pretty light on technical details and there could [and perhaps should] have been much more beyond-the-scenes content, as well as references to specific documents and events in order to justify this courses existence.In other words, if you are a techie and are indeed interested in this topic, chances are that you already know most of the material taught.",0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

Many of the assessment questions ask about issues which are either overly specific or simply incorrect (this is a very small percentage, but it is noticeable). The pace of the videos is also slow and oddly punctuated to the point that it can be difficult to follow at times. Finally, the course relies too heavily on academic writing for the hard sciences, rather than taking a broader approach, so some students may wish to keep this in mind when watching, as some advice may not be applicable to their own discipline.Overall, a recommended course for ESL academics, but could do with some improvement.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0

"The course information was fairly useful, but the execution not so much. The material spent more time on somewhat repetitive examples than it did on explaining the actual concepts those examples were illustrating, and the videos were primarily just lecturers reading parts of the slides that you had already read, but in their own words.The tests, sadly, were poorly-designed for the subject matter of the course. Behavioral biases - like many psychological phenomena - overlap to some degree, and the frequently-used format of choose all that apply - or worse choose all that might apply - resulted in trying to guess what the test-setter was looking for rather than trying to apply the information that had been learned. When you find yourself trying to decide between the best answer based on what you have learned and a conceptually worse answer that happens to meet the wording of the question - and trying to guess whether the test-setter is looking to prove your understanding or catch you in a mistake - then you start to suspect that the course has been designed more as a way to earn grades than to actually learn.",1.0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"Superb. This is the first MOOC I managed to finish, and now Im actively exploring all the extra resources and videos from the course.I originally enrolled looking for tips on how to make my courses more accessible for my students (Im a college instructor), and also to help me hone my learning skills, since Im starting to delve on different fields of study. Not only did I achieve those goals, but Im also very excited to explore new MOOCs and online study possibilities.The only downside, if one could say such, is that this course sets quite a high bar in how a MOOC should be: one can easily percieve that everything about its format -- from the weekly newsletter to the videos length and visuals to the structure and syllabus -- is made with careful consideration of the context of online learning, and of the fundamentals of neuroscience the course shares with the students.

MOOCs arent as well tailored as this one.I absolutely recommend it to anyone who is interested (even if frustrated!) with learning, be it independently, online or in a traditional classroom environment.

"This course was ultimately frustrating to take. There is a gap in the material presented and the skill set needed to complete the assignments. Using optional methods to complete this course, such as to use the textbook and forums, is too time consuming (deciphering a text book) or insulting (forum mentor responses).To to solve the assignments, it usually involved trying to 1. refreshing yourself in math concepts not used by a beginner or non-mathematician, 2. deciphering what exactly the poorly written questions were asking, 3. scouring the textbook or internet for functions or strategies never covered in the lecture, 4. having snarky and unhelpful remarks by mentors.The unprofessional behavior of the mentors was especially hard to handle. Even from the early weeks lectures we learned about semantics, and how simple mistyping could lead to programming errors, so I wrongly assumed the mentors would understand that some of us would probably make simple errors. For example, in the final homework I had a simple mistake, but since we cannot show code, it led to more frustration and a mentor basically just saying we covered this already. Im well aware of what we covered, but if someone is stuck on a problem, there needs to be a much better way of helping that person. I did not want to write in the forums after my initial foray in the forum led one mentor to just tell me your logic is wrong, and the spout the same simple strategies of the lecture that could not help on the complex assignment.There probably will not be anything fixed with this course since it seems like it has been the same for years now. Please fix the questions, stop using Project Euler, and let people directly message code to mentors. Will probably save time rather than try to blindly (and frustratingly) explain code over and over again. Ultimately, I felt that unless someone either has previous experience in coding, or has no work to do other than to do this course, it still is not worth it to just obtain a certificate.",1.0,0,1,1,1,1.0,0,0,1
"I have finished this course and moved on to the 2nd part. In sum, the course was excellent and Professor Fowler is terrific at explaining concepts both visually and algebraically. He provides both rigorous and intuitive explanations. I learned a lot and firmed up many concepts. i really appreciated the balance between visual and numerical. The real problem with the course is the quiz CPU. It does not recognize correct answers even when those answers are exactly the same as the ones provided by way of correcting your wrong answer. There is something really wrong with the quiz review code. That can be a downer when you are seeking a little encouragement after some hard work - and you know your answers are correct - and In Fact have been correct on the same questions in earlier quizzes. So take the coruse - enjoy the learning - but dont be discouraged because Coursera writes Kludgey code.IThe course is not yet over but perhaps someone will see this and make some changes. The professor is clear and enthusiastic. The main problem with this course is the quizzes. On several occasions I have submitted answers that were completely correct, only to find them all graded incorrect. I know they were correct because I had mathematician friends check them after receiving the failing grades. They could not understand why the quizzes were returned that way. On certain occasions, questions on one quiz were graded correct - and then the exact same type of question on another quiz was graded incorrect. In some cases, my answers were exactly the same as those probided by way of demonstrating the correct responses. Identical - yet marked wrong. When there are several ways to formulate an answer, we have no way of knowing what form is required. On a recent quiz, it turned out the answers were required in raw form - not solved to their numeric conclusion. But how are we to know that? I will write more at the end of the course. It is a good course for learning - but dont get upset if you get a bad grade. It is probably not an accurate reflection of your work. A final point - Professor Fowler should learn to pronounce integral. It is NOT intregal. It is integral. He is, after all, a mathematician.

"The Worst Course EVER on Coursera:It is important to realize at the outset that I am a very avid learner and always give everything a chance to be completely tried out before giving a judgement, and unfortunately, this course is by far, the only bad course Ive encountered on Coursera for the following reasons:1- The professor wastes a whole weeks module on explaining something trivial like the interest rate and compound interest rate without naming the necessary terminology that is commonly used.2- To make things worse, he has a condescending perspective on students and wastes so much time glorifying himself in an upsetting manner that patronizes learners.3- His demeanour is unprofessional and quite disturbing when he gives mentions at the end of the week that I can feel you. I can feel each one of you now to the degree that even the camera-person filming him cuts his nonsense out.4- After putting up with all his boring nonsense that I already know, despite being a linguist not a finance person, I gave him a chance and started doing his first 10-question Quiz, which was completely isolated from reality and unrelated to his course material or teaching.5- All questions were boring and calculation-intensive, and I still gave him and a chance and went through the whole boring set of 10 questions just to tell me that it needs upgrading for such a banal and facile course.Now, I have an idea about the level of Teaching at Michigan University and I will recommend all my friends not to attend such a university due to the previously-mentioned reasons.A complete waste of space.",0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1

"I broke every rule of efficient and effective learning until I met this course, Dr. Barbara Oakley Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, and the book: “A Mind for Numbers”.I wish I had met your group and this powerful vehicle of learning earlier –university wouldn’t have been so costly (studying the inefficient way) and the rewards could be even more phenomenal with this awareness. Nevertheless, your incredible work will continue to help mitigate the cost.Although I maintained good grades through university primarily because of my high enthusiasm, interest and determination to achieve excellence in life–long learning, but the personal cost was undue stress –over studying, keeping many late nights, dependency on caffeine and life-work-family balance. However, I imagined there had to be a better way.The frustrations and occasionally being at my wits end in solving some of the problems in the computer programming languages I am currently learning have instantly dissipated because of this course. I have completely changed my old and inefficient learning methods and formed new habits for learning.Amazingly, I failed to solve the triangle problem on the first try at the end of a long day of work and study (after staring at it for about 45mins) in the book: “A Mind For Numbers” by Dr. Barbara Oakley. However, determined, I gave it another shot the next morning, right after waking up -it took me less than 30 seconds to solve. You’ve got to love the diffuse mode…While I love academia and stand ready to dance with whatever pain it dishes out at me in my life-long learning journey, this course has single-handedly removed current and whatever inherent or perceived pain that may be associated with life-long academic learning for me.There is a better way to rote learning method -a different, efficient and effective approach… Academic goal or any subject matter no longer need to take many years of painful endurance to achieve or master.This course has armed me with the ultimate set of tools to expertly construct efficient and effective learning methods with measureable success. Essentially, I have learned how to hack my academic growth and goal.Finally, in the past, I stumbled upon one or two of the methods taught in this course in academic journals and other articles. However, these occasional, inconsistent and isolated pieces of information were not cohesive to form a powerful enough force to help build a fundamental understanding and practice of efficient learning methods. Additionally, overpowering the well-formed habit of the inefficient rote learning method was a challenge.Fortunately, this course and the book: “A Mind For Numbers” by Dr. Barbara Oakley, compiled and put all of these scientific data on efficient learning methods in to proper perspective, easy enough for anyone to understand and practice.In the afterword chapter of the book, Dr. David B. Daniel said it best:“There has long been a stream of potentially productive study advice coming from scientists. Unfortunately, it has seldom been translated so the average student can easily grasp and use it. Not every scientist has a knack for translation, and not every writer has a firm grasp of the science. In this book, Barbara Oakley threaded this needle beautifully. Her use of vivid examples and explanations of the strategies reveals not only how useful but how credible these ideas are.”Thank you Dr. Barbara Oakley and the Learning How to Learn Team for a job well done!

"The course covers a lot of interesting topics i a short time, citing external documents, webpages and books; sometimes some questions in the quiz refer to external documents.About the assignment: it start quite easy, about high concept, story bible, game design document, making the student write more and more detailed, focusing all the attention on the documents. Than, at week4, you need to create a prototype, digital or non-digital, based on your creations. I found this unexpected and really its unrealistic to be able to create a decent prototype in the same amount of time given to write a document.About the grading system: to take the best score, you need to go epicly beyond the call of duty. I dont like that. A student should take the maximum score if he does everything required, and he/she does it good. No need to overdo in my opinion.About the quiz: if you make mistakes, he doesnt tell you whats wrong, he doesnt show you the right answer.

"The course is effectively a tutorial on how to use proprietary software to solve a range of machine learning problems.I liked the fact that the course covered a wide range of problems quickly.

Most of the course was dedicated to explaining particular problems, the solution to which was inevitably “then you train this really clever, one-line algorithm we have written for you and you query it for insights”. I felt a little cheated by this approach to a subject which should be really fascinating.While some of my concerns may be addressed in follow on courses, I am left with little insight into what really lies ahead.

"This course does not live up to the high value that Ive come to enjoy and expect at Coursera. The videos are read by the teachers, so the inflections are wrong, making it very hard to follow. The videos are clipped short and cut off the words at the end. The information is given so quickly with terms not explained that a novice will likely not understand parts of it.

It is a well structured course covering a lot of ground that is certainly worthy of your time.

"Excellent course, period.This is the first course Ive taken from Coursera. Before the course I knew something about HTML, CSS and Javascript but not too much. First week is a piece of cake. Second week was also easy but I did not have a strong logic about the box model before, after the second week I had it.With third week things went in a strange way, but in a positive one. We started to code a real website (yeah youll understand if you enroll) from scratch. This was invaluable for me. Reading documents is something, but watching lectures, interact with the real code, try and see way, using Git and Github, getting great tips, I mean doing real stuff is invaluable.Fourth week is also not so hard for me since I have some basic Javascript history. And Javascript section is not so detailed and difficult, but just for one week it was beyond OK, it was great. Even in basic info youll learn something.Fifth week is a total stranger for me since I dont know anything about Ajax or dynamic loading pages style. Ok, I know what was Ajax but just the name :) So, after the week Ive learned those. At least the concept itself and how to implement it in a simple web site. But I must confess, I watched the videos twice and examine the codes again and again to fully understand what we are doing and how we are doing. Because a week is not enough for this and things go faster. But hey, lectures are recorded and you can watch them again right :) And you have all the codes!Beauty of this course is all the weeks and assignments are related and integrated. So you learn something, finish the assignment. Next week, you learn new things, get new assignments but continue the last weeks job. Yeah, you remember the real web site part?And of course last but not least Mr. Yaakov Chaikin is a great instructor and person! He has an excellent way of teaching.So, if you are a total newbie or someone who is beginning of his journey like me do not hesitate to enroll this course.

"As I was taking this class, I often wondered who the target audience was. Although the class has no listed prerequisites, I noticed a lot of engineering jargon being used without ever defining what it meant. Im not sure that non-technical people would get much out of the lectures. On the other hand, the lectures were mostly at a superficial level, so Im not sure that technical people would get much out of them either. The only topic that got a (somewhat) deep dive was serial communication, and it wasnt clear why; users of the Arduino dont need to understand it any more or less than any other aspect of how an Arduino works.There were other issues. The programs we wrote had to be pasted into a submission form that removed all the carriage returns when you hit Save; I had to manually fix my program each time. Perhaps most frustratingly, you could follow the assignment instructions to the letter, but after you submitted you might find out that the grading criteria included other requirements. In one case people asked about it, and it turned out that the grading criteria were wrong, but they were never updated.
